scenarios:
  - name: close-tab-fallback
    description: >
      Through the running dashboard in a real browser, open the session interface (Enter) with at least
      two live sessions, A and B. Closing is reached ONLY by right-clicking a session row → "Close" →
      confirming the prompt (there is no header close button). First confirm the header carries no close
      control: with A selected, the action row shows only the state-driven buttons (nav, proof, relaunch/
      merge), never a "close"/kill button. Then two passes. PASS 1 — select A's tab, right-click A's row,
      pick Close, confirm, and watch where the view lands. PASS 2 — select A's tab, right-click A's row,
      pick Close, confirm, then immediately switch to B's tab while the close request is still in flight,
      and watch whether the view stays put. Measure by screenshotting the tab list + active pane before
      and after each close.
    expected: |
      The header action row never shows a close/kill button — closing is only on the row's right-click
      menu, behind a confirm. Pass 1: closing the tab you are viewing lands you on the New Session tab;
      A's row is gone from the list. Pass 2: having switched to B before the close settles, the view STAYS
      on B — the close never yanks you back to New Session. In neither case is the selected tab left
      pointing at a session the board no longer lists.
  - name: exit-command-closes
    description: >
      Through the running dashboard in a real browser, open the session interface (Enter) on a LIVE
      (non-offline) session whose `❯` box is enabled. Type exactly `/exit` into the box (dismiss the `/`
      completion menu if it opened, so Enter dispatches rather than completes) and press Enter. Watch the
      session list and active pane. Screenshot the tab list + pane before typing and after Enter settles.
    expected: |
      The session closes outright — its row drops off the list and the view lands on New Session, the same
      removal the row-menu Close performs — but with NO confirmation prompt (typing the exact command IS the
      deliberate confirmation). The literal text `/exit` is never dispatched into the terminal/agent (the
      read-only pane shows no new `/exit` line). Any other text, including `/exit` with trailing words,
      dispatches normally to the agent.
  - name: board-command-parity
    description: >
      Through the running dashboard in a real browser, open the session interface (Enter) on a session in the
      REVIEW state (so nav + proof + merge all apply). (1) Read the header action row: confirm three small
      TEXT buttons — nav, proof, merge — with NO leading glyph/emoji (no ⌨ keyboard, no ◆ diamond), each
      rendered in a distinct colour. (2) In the `❯` inbox type `/` and read the completion menu: the board's
      own commands (`/nav`, `/proof`, `/merge`, `/exit`) lead the list, each `/name` and its `[board]` tag
      painted the SAME colour as the matching button, visibly apart from Claude Code's blue command rows.
      (3) Type `/proof` and Enter: the proof overlay opens — identical to clicking the proof button; close it,
      then click the proof button and confirm the SAME overlay opens. (4) Type `/nav` and Enter: nav mode
      engages (the `❯` box becomes the nav indicator AND the nav button shows its active `.on` state); click
      the nav button to toggle it back off. Screenshot the action row and the `/` menu.
    expected: |
      The action-row buttons are text-only (no glyphs/emoji) and colour-coded — nav yellow (var --yellow =
      rgb(181,137,0)), proof cyan (var --cyan = rgb(42,161,152)), merge green (var --green = rgb(133,153,0)).
      In the `/` menu the four board commands lead, each name + `[board]` tag in its identity colour — the
      SAME hue as its button (nav yellow, proof cyan, merge green, exit red = rgb(220,50,47)) — while CC's
      commands stay blue (rgb(38,139,210)); one element, one colour in both places. Typing `/proof` opens the
      very overlay the proof button opens (one shared open-state); typing `/nav` toggles nav mode exactly as
      the nav button does, and the button reflects that same state. A board command is never dispatched to the
      agent — its line is intercepted and the draft cleared — so no `/proof`/`/nav` text reaches the pane.
  - name: status-word-colour
    description: >
      Through the running dashboard in a real browser, with several live sessions in DIFFERENT states (at
      minimum a `working`, an `asking`, and a `close-pending`), look at the top-left SessionWindow glance.
      For each row read the status word's RENDERED colour (computed `color`), not just its text, and compare
      against the pre-change baseline (the MAIN dashboard, where every status word is the same muted grey).
      Screenshot the SessionWindow on both so the contrast is visible.
    expected: |
      On the changed dashboard each status word is painted by its bucket hue from the single STATUS_COLOR
      map — four hues only: `working` and `parked` green (var --green = rgb(133,153,0)); the waiting-on-you
      states `asking`/`review`/`done` yellow (var --yellow = rgb(181,137,0)); `error` red; and the dormant
      rest (`idle`/`starting`/`queued`/`close-pending`/`offline`) muted grey (rgb(147,161,161)). On the
      MAIN baseline every word is that same muted grey regardless of state. The word's colour equals the
      session's liveness-dot colour on the surfaces that draw a dot (same source), and `working` green
      matches the avatar's liveness ring — dot, word, and ring never disagree.

# session-console — yatsu

Measure through the **real dashboard surface**, YATU-style: drive the actual browser interface (open with
`Enter`, click the tabs, and close via the **session row's right-click menu → Close → confirm** — there is no
header close button), never a direct `/api/sessions/:id/close` call or an internal selection helper. The loss
being scored is the tab-fallback contract in the spec: a closed session leaves the board, and that **removal**
— not the closing gesture — is what decides where you land. You are still on the closed tab → New Session; you
already moved to another valid tab → your switch stands. Evidence is a before/after screenshot pair of the tab
list and active pane for each pass.
