# session-selectors

## raw source

A user names a session several ways — its full id, a short id-prefix, its node, or its branch — and every
session command should understand the SAME names. The bug this node removes: the list verbs (`ls` / `watch` /
`wait` / the graph) matched on all four, but the control verbs (`review` / `merge` / `send` / `close` /
`reopen` / `capture` / `prompt`) took a RAW id straight to the backend's exact-match endpoint, so a
prefix / node / branch selector worked for `ls` but NOT for `merge` — forcing callers to hand-resolve full
ids. One grammar, one matcher, no per-command matching logic anywhere.

## expanded spec

**One predicate.** `matchesSelector(session, q)` is the single rule: `q` matches a session iff it is the
session's full id, an id-PREFIX, its node, or its branch. Nothing re-derives it — both shapes below call it,
so the grammar can never drift between "which sessions does `ls` show" and "which session does `merge` act on".

**Two shapes over the one predicate.** `selectSessions` is the MANY shape — the list / stream / graph filter
([[graph]], `spex ls`): empty selectors (or `@all`) means everything, with an optional status filter on top.
`resolveSession` is the ONE shape — the single-target lookup the control verbs need. Its result is
DISCRIMINATED so a caller fails precisely: `ok` (one match), `ambiguous` (a prefix or node hitting several —
carried so the user can be told which), `none` (nothing). An exact full-id match wins outright, so a full id
is never reported ambiguous merely because it prefixes a longer one.

**Every control verb routes through it.** Because the backend's `/api/sessions/:id` matches the id EXACTLY,
each control verb resolves the selector FIRST — against the live board, via [[remote-client]]'s
`resolveClientSession` — and then calls with the resolved FULL id. The CLI turns a non-`ok` result into a
precise error and a non-zero exit (`none` → no such session; `ambiguous` → the candidates). So the read verbs
and the control verbs share one selector grammar, and no command carries its own matching.

The **local state producers** (`session done` / `park` / `ask`, and `review`-as-propose) are deliberately NOT
here: they write the cwd worktree's own `.session` and must work with no backend up ([[state]]), so they
resolve against the local worktree, never the backend board.
