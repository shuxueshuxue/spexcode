scenarios:
  - name: renders-merged-issues
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: spec-dashboard/src/IssuesPage.jsx
    description: >-
      Run the dashboard against a backend whose issues span both stores (a local thread with a signer +
      reply, forge issues). Open #/issues and read the rendered DOM: the issue group's rows, then select
      the local thread and read the detail pane; check for raw markdown syntax in the detail.
    expected: >-
      The issue group renders the non-concluded rows in the API's order (no re-sort/rank): one compact
      line each, LEADING with the issue itself — a status-colored dot, then the concern; the trailing
      edge carries only quiet meta (a compact reply-count pill, and a borderless muted store mini-tag
      present only because the stores are mixed). NO boxed store chip leads any row. Concluded issues
      (closed/rejected/landed) are hidden behind a count chip that reveals them. Selecting the local
      thread opens it in the RIGHT detail pane: the title is the concern ALONE (no store chip on the
      title); the meta strip under it carries status, the store tag, author, "+N signed", clickable node
      chips; the body and replies MARKDOWN-RENDERED (headings/tables/lists — no raw `##` or `|` pipes
      visible), and a reply composer. A forge selection renders the SAME way — its GitHub comments as
      the reply thread, its permalink in the meta strip, and the SAME composer (no read-only note
      exists) — store never changes the thread's shape. No page errors.
  - name: composer-mention-autocomplete
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: [spec-dashboard/src/IssuesPage.jsx, spec-dashboard/src/mentions.jsx]
    description: >-
      On the running issues page, select a LOCAL issue and type into its reply composer, then open the
      New form and type into its body textarea. In each: type `@`, read the dropdown, pick a row with
      ↓/Enter and read the inserted text; clear, type `[[` (and a partial id), pick, read the insertion;
      press Esc with a menu open and read the hash; type plain prose and look for any menu. Then visit
      the session console and re-check its `@`/`[[` menus still open (the shared-module regression).
    expected: >-
      Both composers carry the console's OWN mention dropdowns ([[mentions]] — one shared menu, not a
      fork): `@` lists the live sessions plus `@new` and a pick inserts `@<id> ` (trailing space); `[[`
      lists the spec nodes (a partial query filters) and a pick inserts `[[<id>]] `. The reply
      composer's menu opens UPWARD (visible above the docked textarea), the New form's downward. Esc
      closes the menu, keeps the draft, and stays on #/issues. Plain text never opens a menu. The
      console's `@`/`[[` menus are unchanged. No page errors.
  - name: issue-reply-video-plays
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: [spec-dashboard/src/Thread.jsx, spec-dashboard/src/Evidence.jsx]
    description: >-
      Cache a real clip with `spex blob put <clip.webm>` (no reading filed), post a LOCAL issue reply
      whose body carries a `![video](/api/yatsu/blob/<hash>)` link (same hash as the reply's evidence),
      plus a reply with an image link and one with a hash whose blob is absent. Open #/issues, select the
      thread, and read each rendered reply's real DOM: the media element's tag, its readyState/currentTime
      after play(), and whether raw markdown link text shows in the prose.
    expected: >-
      The video-linked reply renders a real playing HTML5 `<video class="eval-video" controls>` sourced
      from /api/yatsu/blob/<hash> — frames decode (readyState ≥ HAVE_CURRENT_DATA, currentTime advances
      after play()), never a broken `<img>` and never raw markdown in the prose. The image link still
      renders as an image (click-to-enlarge), and the absent blob renders the honest miss sentinel. The
      element is the SAME shared-renderer output the eval tab and eval detail produce for the same hash —
      one evidence renderer, every home.
  - name: composer-docked-autogrow
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: [spec-dashboard/src/IssuesPage.jsx, spec-dashboard/src/Thread.jsx, spec-dashboard/src/textarea.js]
    description: >-
      On the running issues page, select an issue whose thread is LONG (body + replies overflow the
      detail pane). WITHOUT scrolling, read the reply composer's geometry (getBoundingClientRect on
      `.fvd-compose` and its textarea) against the viewport; read the collapsed textarea's height and
      whether the actions row (`.fv-actions`) is present. Focus the textarea and re-read; type several
      lines and read the height after each; clear and blur and re-read. Then scroll the thread region
      and read whether the composer moved. Repeat the collapsed/engaged reading on an eval detail's
      rail composer (#/evals).
    expected: >-
      The composer is DOCKED at the detail pane's foot — visible in the viewport immediately on
      selection, no scrolling needed even on a long thread; the thread scrolls in its own region
      (`.fvd-scroll`) behind it and the composer never moves. Idle, it is COLLAPSED: a single-line
      textarea, no actions row. Focusing reveals the actions row (hint + Send); typing grows the
      textarea line by line (capped — it never eats the pane), and deleting shrinks it back. An
      emptied, blurred composer collapses back to one line. Switching to another issue clears the
      draft (keyed to the selection). The eval detail's rail composer shows the SAME collapsed→engaged
      shape — one shared composer, every home. No page errors.
  - name: panel-skeleton
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: spec-dashboard/src/IssuesPage.jsx
    description: >-
      On the running issues page (#/issues), read the master-detail shell: the grid split and the LIST
      COLUMN'S MEASURED WIDTH, the left box (NO tab switcher — the Issues page is its own top-level route
      now), which container scrolls, the sticky filter bar. Click the fold toggle and re-measure the
      columns; unfold. Drive j/k in the issue list; select a row and read the detail pane; finally type
      'j' inside the New-form input.
    expected: >-
      The page is a two-column grid whose LEFT column is SLIM (compact one-line rows, at most ~280px —
      the detail is the protagonist): ONE box — the merged issue list under its own
      sticky filter bar (the store filter + New + the concluded chip, with the open/total meta at its
      END), NO Evals|Threads tab switcher present; its list gets the full column height, scrolling
      itself; the RIGHT detail pane scrolls independently, the page itself never scrolls. The fold
      toggle collapses the list to a thin strip (the detail takes essentially the full width) and the
      strip unfolds it with filters and selection intact. The list
      renders INSTANTLY from app-resident issues (no per-mount fetch). j/k move ONE visible selection in
      the issue list and the detail pane follows immediately — selection IS detail, nothing expands
      inside the list. Deep j keeps the selected row inside the left column's viewport. A key typed into
      an input/textarea reaches the input and never moves the selection. No page errors.
  - name: new-form-node-links
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: spec-dashboard/src/IssuesPage.jsx
    description: >-
      On the running issues page, open the New form and count its text surfaces; then post an issue whose
      concern is plain prose and whose body links a real node with `[[<id>]]`. After the post lands,
      select the new thread and read its detail meta strip (`.fvd-meta`).
    expected: >-
      The form carries exactly TWO text surfaces — the concern input and the body textarea; NO node-ids
      field exists (nothing placeholder-labelled "node ids"). The posted thread's detail header shows the
      linked node as a clickable chip — the store inferred `nodes:` from the body's `[[…]]` link
      ([[local-issues]]), the writer never re-typed an id into a separate field. No page errors.
  - name: signed-badge-only-when-nonzero
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: spec-dashboard/src/IssuesPage.jsx
    description: >-
      Run the dashboard against a backend with two LOCAL issues: one with ZERO signers, one with ≥1
      signers. Open #/issues, select each, and read the detail meta strip (`.fvd-meta`) — look for the
      signed badge (`.fv-count` reading "+N signed").
    expected: >-
      The zero-signer issue's detail shows NO signed badge at all (a "+0 signed" is noise — suppressed,
      mirroring the CLI's own nonzero guard). The signed issue shows "+N signed" with the true count. The
      sign feature is otherwise unchanged. No page errors.
  - name: originator-liveness-shown
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: spec-dashboard/src/Thread.jsx
    description: >-
      Run the dashboard against a backend whose board lists live sessions. Seed one LOCAL issue whose `by`
      is an ONLINE session id and one whose `by` is an id absent from the board. Open #/issues, select
      each, and read the detail header's originator pill (`.fv-originator`): its alive/offline class, the
      dot's computed background colour, and the reach phrase.
    expected: >-
      Each local issue's header shows the originator id with a liveness dot and reach phrase. The ONLINE
      originator reads `alive` (a status-hued dot from the board's `STATUS_COLOR`, "alive · replies reach
      it live") — an un-@'d reply courtesy-delivers to it. The absent originator reads `offline` (muted
      dot, "offline · replies skip it"). A forge issue's github-login `by` resolves to no session and
      stays a plain author label. No second palette, no page errors.

# measuring issues-view

YATU through the REAL running dashboard, never the code: a backend seeded with local + forge issues, the
worktree dashboard pointed at it, and a headless Chromium that opens #/issues and reads the live DOM
(`.fv-master`, `.fv-row`, `.fv-store`, `.fvd`, `.doc-body`) + screenshots it. The loss is the gap between
that reading and the spec: a master-detail Issues page (its own top-level route, no in-page switcher),
one merged store-tagged list in API order, markdown-rendered detail, one thread surface and one composer
over both stores. (This reading style is
what caught the `t(...)` i18n call-convention crash a build could not.)
