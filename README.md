# SpexCode

Spec-driven development with AI agents in the loop. SpexCode keeps a versioned tree of specs inside
your git repo, links every spec to the code it governs, and runs a session manager that dispatches
coding agents into isolated worktrees. You review and merge; the tool keeps intent and
implementation from drifting apart.

## The model

A spec node is a directory under `.spec/` containing a `spec.md`: frontmatter (title, status, a
`code:` list of the files it governs) plus a prose body stating what that part of the system is
supposed to do, right now. Nodes nest, so the tree mirrors how you think about the project rather
than the file layout. The body itself has two owners: a short human-written **raw source** (the
intent; changing it needs a human), and an agent-written **expanded spec** (the detailed reading of
that intent; iterates freely, must always match the raw source).

<img src="docs/readme-node.png" alt="A spec node on the dashboard: human-owned raw source, agent-owned expanded spec, a DRIFT badge, and the files it governs">

Three rules make this workable:

1. **Git is the database.** There is no separate store. A node's version count is the number of
   commits that touched its `spec.md`; its history view is `git log` on that file; each version is
   attributed, via a `Session:` commit trailer, to the agent session that wrote it. The dashboard is
   a read-time aggregator over git.
2. **The body is a living document.** It always describes present intent and is rewritten in place.
   Changelog headings are banned from spec bodies (the linter enforces this); git already keeps the
   history.
3. **Spec and code land together.** A change is one commit that updates both the `spec.md` and the
   code it justifies. Code that silently diverges from its spec is the one forbidden move.

Read as an optimization loop: the spec states the target, yatsu measurements score how far live
behavior sits from it, and commits move the code toward the target.

## Quick start

Requires Node ≥ 22 and git. This part is plain tooling — no AI involved yet.

```sh
npm i -g spexcode        # installs the `spex` command
cd your-repo
spex init                # seeds .spec/, installs git hooks, renders the agent contract
spex serve               # API backend on :8787
spex dashboard           # board UI on :5173, proxying to the backend
```

`spex init` is additive. It works on any existing git repo and never overwrites your files: it
seeds a root `.spec/project/spec.md`, plants a starter `spexcode.json`, installs the pre-commit
hooks, and writes a managed block into `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` so any agent working in the repo
discovers the workflow on its own.

Then grow the tree:

1. Edit `.spec/project/spec.md` to describe the project.
2. Add child nodes for the parts you want governed, each with a `code:` list pointing at existing
   files.
3. Run `spex lint`. Coverage warnings list the source files no spec claims yet; that list is your
   adoption TODO.

You are not expected to hand-author all of this. The intended workflow is to have an agent do most
of the spec writing; `spex guide spec` prints the exact file format it needs.
[Getting started](https://spexcode.net/getting-started/) on the docs site walks the setup end to
end.

## Working with agents

This part needs tmux and a logged-in [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) or Codex
on the machine.

```sh
spex new "make the settings page remember the last tab" --node settings
```

launches a worker session in its own worktree on branch `node/settings`. The worker reads the
governing spec before touching code, makes the change, rewrites the spec body to match, commits
both (a hook stamps the `Session:` trailer), then proposes a merge and stops. Workers never merge
themselves.

You supervise from outside — on the board, or with the same commands your agent uses:

```sh
spex watch              # stream session transitions: launched / review / done / needs-input ...
spex review settings    # commits ahead of trunk, merge-base diff, typecheck/lint gates
spex merge settings     # gated merge into the trunk
spex session close settings
```

Independent tasks run in parallel. Each worker is isolated in its own worktree, git serializes the
merges, and a pre-commit guard blocks direct commits on the trunk, so everything flows through
reviewable node branches.

The process is enforced by mechanism, not prompt engineering: the backend creates the branch, a
hook stamps the attribution, the materialized contract block carries the rules. Your dispatch
prompt stays task-only. [Working with agents](https://spexcode.net/working-with-agents/) on the
docs site covers this way of driving SpexCode in full.

## Measuring behavior: yatsu

A spec says what a part should do; a `yatsu.md` beside it says how to check. Each scenario is a
plain description plus an expected result. There is no DSL and yatsu executes nothing: an agent
runs the scenario however is honest (a test file, a real browser, by hand), compares actual to
expected, and files the reading with evidence:

```sh
spex yatsu eval settings --scenario remembers-tab --pass --image proof.png
```

Readings live in a git-tracked ndjson next to the spec, so measurements get the same attribution
and history as spec versions. Bug fixes are expected to bracket: file a failing reading that
reproduces the bug, fix, then file a passing reading on the same scenario.

## What's in the repo

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `spec-cli` | The `spex` CLI and the HTTP backend (Hono, runs via tsx, no build step). Reads `.spec` and git live; owns the session state machine and the linter. |
| `spec-dashboard` | React board: the node graph, per-node spec/history/issues panes, and a real terminal onto each live agent session. |
| `spec-yatsu` | The measurement bookkeeping described above. |
| `spec-forge` | Read-only tracer that resolves a forge's open issues and PRs to the spec nodes they serve (GitHub today). An issue links itself with a `Spec: <node-id>` line in its body; a PR from a `node/<id>` branch links for free. |

## The linter

`spex lint` checks the spec↔code graph and is the real gate (the git hook is fast local feedback):

- **integrity** (error): a `code:` path that doesn't exist
- **living** (error): a changelog heading in a spec body
- **altitude** (warn): a body that slid from contract prose into an implementation dump
- **coverage** (warn): a governed source file no spec claims
- **drift** (warn): governed code changed after its spec's last version, derived live from git

## Configuration

`spexcode.json` (committed, portable: layout, lint budgets, dashboard identity, launcher names) and
`spexcode.local.json` (gitignored, host-specific: absolute launcher paths, plus a `private: true`
overlay for repos you use but don't own) cover every setting. There is no `spex config set`; you or
your agent edit the files directly, and `spex guide config` documents every field. The other
manuals are `spex guide` (the workflow), `spex guide spec`, and `spex guide yatsu`; `spex help`
maps the commands.

## Status

SpexCode develops itself with itself: the `.spec/` tree in this repo is the tool's own spec, every
change lands through the worker/manager loop above, and the dashboard you install is the one used
to build it. It is a young tool; expect some sharp edges. The first public write-up was posted on
the [LINUX DO](https://linux.do) community — thanks for the first round of discussion there.
