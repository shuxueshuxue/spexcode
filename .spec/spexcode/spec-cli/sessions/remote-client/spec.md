# remote-client

## raw source

A session's live state lives where its tmux and worktrees are — on the backend's machine. So the `spex` CLI
must not read or drive sessions in its own process: a manager on one machine should monitor and drive an
agent on another, and there must be exactly **one** actor on a given tmux socket. The CLI's **read and
control** verbs are therefore thin clients of the running backend, the same way the dashboard is — the
backend is the single broker, and which machine you point at is just a URL.

## expanded spec

The read/control commands — `ls`, `watch`, `wait`, `capture`, `send`, `review`, `merge`, `reopen`, `close`,
`prompt` — call the backend over HTTP (`SPEXCODE_API_URL`, else the local default). They hold **no**
in-process tmux/git path, so the backend is the **single actor** on the tmux socket and the single source of
derived state, and pointing `SPEXCODE_API_URL` at another machine's backend monitors and drives THAT
machine's sessions with no code change — the dashboard's viewer-points-anywhere model, extended to the CLI.
`watch`/`wait` take the board **source** as a required argument (the backend client), so a poll can never
silently read a local board by default.

The split is load-bearing and is the whole point. State **producers** stay **local**: `done`/`ask`/`block`/
`idle` and the lifecycle hooks write the cwd worktree's `.session` (see [[state]]) — that file is HOW the
backend learns state, so an agent must be able to declare its own even with no backend up. **Launch**
(`spex new`) keeps its own already-justified path (it needs the backend's auth env — see [[launch]]). Only
the verbs that observe or drive live tmux route here.

**One availability rule, FAIL LOUD.** Unlike a best-effort telemetry POST, an unreachable backend throws a
clear `no backend reachable at <url>` and a non-zero exit — never a silent fall back to a local in-process
path, because that fallback is exactly what would re-create two actors on one tmux socket. `watch` warns once
and keeps streaming (a backend blip must not read as "all sessions fine"); `wait` fails loud rather than
reporting a false timeout.

**Failure stays distinct from emptiness.** A monitoring read must let a manager tell "I couldn't read" from
"the screen is blank": `capture` returns a genuinely empty pane as success, but maps unknown-session,
offline (no live pane), and a capture error to distinct non-zero outcomes — a blank screen that exits 0 is
never confused with a read that failed.
