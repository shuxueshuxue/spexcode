// the parent's row, sized only by that node's OWN child count. So switching focus within a column never
// moves that column — only the deeper column (the newly-focused node's children) appears, centred on it.
// This deliberately replaces the bottom-up centroid model (leaves stacked into ONE global row counter,
// parents at their kids' midpoint), under which a deep expansion's leaf count spread the SHALLOW siblings
// apart. `expanded` is the focused node's ancestor SPINE (the caller passes exactly that), so there is one
// expanded node per column and sibling children-blocks never collide; every other subtree is a collapsed
// leaf tile, which keeps the root layer a short column however deep/bushy the real tree is. Gaps track the
// node box: a node is TWO rows (title + editor/last-edited line) and a touch wider for longer titles, so
// X_GAP/Y_GAP keep rows from touching.
