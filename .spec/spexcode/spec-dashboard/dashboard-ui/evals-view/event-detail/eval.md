    description: >
      On #/evals, select a video reading whose thread holds several anchored remarks. Unfold the remark
      rail (click its folded strip), then measure the detail pane's geometry: the header band's height
      and contents; whether the media stage AND the remark rail's composer are BOTH within the viewport
      at once (getBoundingClientRect on the video and on the composer textarea); scroll the rail's remark
      list and read whether the video moved; type into the composer and read whether the stage scrolled.
      Then narrow the window under the breakpoint and re-read the layout.
    expected: |
      The detail is a WORKSPACE, not a scroll stack: a slim header (scenario · node · verdict badge ·
      A/B strip), then the media stage and the remark rail SIDE BY SIDE once the rail is unfolded — the
      video and the composer are simultaneously visible with NO scrolling (the composer is docked at the
      rail's foot, never below the media/gallery/thread stack). Scrolling the rail's remark list never
      moves the stage; the stage scrolls itself when its gallery overflows. Circle→remark→circle needs
      zero vertical travel — the old top-bottom ping-pong is gone. Under the narrow breakpoint the
      workspace degrades to one stacked column (stage over rail) instead of clipping.

    code: [spec-dashboard/src/EventDetail.jsx, spec-dashboard/src/FoldToggle.jsx]
    description: >
      On #/evals, select a video reading whose thread holds remarks (at least one unresolved). Read the
      workspace's initial state: is the remark rail hidden behind a thin right-edge strip (the shared
      fold-strip affordance, `.an-rail-unfold`), and does the strip carry the remark count? Click the
      strip and read the rail (list + composer + a fold badge in its head). Click the head's fold badge
      and re-read. Unfold again is NOT clicked — instead drag-circle a region on the paused frame and
      read whether the rail opened on its own with the prefilled composer focused. Then click a scrubber
      comment marker while the rail is folded and read the rail. Switch selection to another row and
      read whether the fold state persisted.
    expected: |
      The remark rail is FOLDED BY DEFAULT on both eval homes: the workspace opens as stage + a thin
      right strip — the SAME shared FoldToggle strip the master lists fold to (one component, one glyph),
      wearing the remark count (accented while any remark is unresolved), so the outstanding loss stays
      glanceable through the fold. Clicking the strip unfolds the full rail — remark list, docked
      composer, and the shared inline fold badge in the rail head, which folds it back to the strip. The
      review act unfolds it WITHOUT the strip: a drag-circle (or `a`) opens the rail with the anchored
      draft prefilled and the composer focused; clicking a scrubber marker (or ↑/↓ jump) opens it with
      that remark selected. The fold state persists across selection switches — a new selection neither
      re-folds an opened rail nor re-opens a folded one. On the phone eval host the fold retires and the
      rail stays open.
  - name: stale-reading-readout
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    description: >
      On #/evals, select a reading whose node's governed code changed after it was taken (a code-stale
      reading — the muted ✓/✗ in the list). Read the detail's stage: is there a stale readout naming the
      moved axes, and for the code axis the drifted file(s) + how many commits behind? Then confirm the
      remark composer works on it exactly as on a fresh reading (type + send a remark).
    expected: |
      A non-fresh viewed reading shows a stale readout on the stage: the freshness axes that moved
      (e.g. `code · scenario`), and for the code axis the drifted governed file(s) with a commits-behind
      count (e.g. `EvalsFeed.jsx +3`). A fresh reading shows NO readout. The readout is reporting only —
      selecting/flipping A/B re-renders it for the viewed reading. The remark composer is unaffected by
      freshness: a remark is authored and sent on a stale reading identically to a fresh one.

    description: >
      On #/evals, select a video reading (carrying a step-timeline sidecar, its thread holding anchored
      comments) in the left list. On the detail workspace's MEDIA STAGE, over the CUSTOM review-track
      player: read the scrubber's comment markers + step bands + duration; click a comment marker and read
      video.currentTime + which comment/marker highlights (the comment lives in the RIGHT RAIL);
      play/pause and read the playhead-active rail comment as it advances; frame-step with '.' and jump
      comments with ↑/↓ and read video.currentTime; press 'a' and read the rail composer's stamped anchor;
      click a step on the ruler; drag on the paused frame to circle a region, read the prefilled composer
      and send it; click the sent comment's anchor chip; read the pane's DOM for any verdict-filing
      controls (pass/fail buttons, a note input, a file-reading action); switch selection to another row
      and back.
    expected: |
      The eval detail IS the event detail — a full-height workspace, no modal — with a CUSTOM player
      (native chrome replaced) on the stage: a scrubber carrying the play-fill + knob, one MARKER per
      anchored comment at its moment, and step BANDS from the timeline; a live time readout + a chip
      naming the step the playhead is in. Clicking a marker SEEKS to that comment (the blob route answers
      byte ranges — without them the browser clamps to 0) AND selects it: the marker and the rail comment
      both highlight, in sync. As the clip plays the playhead-ACTIVE comment lights and the step chip
      flips at each boundary. The keyboard drives it — space play/pause, ←→ ±5s (⇧ 1s), , . frame-fine,
      ↑↓ jump to the prev/next comment (seek + select), 'a' stamps a `▶m:ss · <step>` anchor into the
      rail's docked composer (+ a `[[node]]` line when the step routes elsewhere) and focuses it. The
      named-step ruler still click-seeks. A drag circles a region: the paused frame (rect burned in) is
      POSTed to /api/evidence and the composer is prefilled with an anchored comment — the anchor line,
      a `![frame](/api/evidence/<hash>)` link, and the routing line — with the stage still on screen.
      Sending it creates/appends the eval's local Issue thread ('eval: <node> · <scenario>') with that
      frame in the body AND on the thread's typed evidence[]; the sent comment shows an anchor chip that
      SEEKS + selects on click and renders the circled frame inline. '@new' dispatches a fresh worker
      with the anchor in its prompt. The pane carries NO verdict-filing controls — no pass/fail bar, no
      verdict-note input, no file-reading button (readings are filed by agents via `spex eval add`; the
      human judges through the remark composer). Switching selection resets the working draft.

    description: >
      On a video reading's detail workspace, make one mark per gesture: drag-circle a region on the paused
      frame, stamp an anchor with the composer's ⏱ button (type a note, send), and press 'a'. Read each
      prefilled/stamped composer draft and, after sending, read the review track's rows (anchor chip,
      prose, media count) and screenshot the rail.
    expected: |
      Every anchored mark carries the FRAME of its moment, whichever gesture made it: the circle burns its
      rect into the captured frame; ⏱ and 'a' capture the clean current frame — all three stamp
      `▶m:ss · step` plus a `![frame](/api/evidence/<hash>)` link (the frame doubling as the remark's
      typed evidence[]). Re-stamping ⏱ at a new moment replaces both the anchor line AND its riding frame,
      so an anchor and its frame never disagree. In the track every anchored remark renders uniformly —
      chip + frame thumbnail (+ prose) — a ⏱/'a' remark is indistinguishable in shape from a circle
      remark. A failed capture degrades to the text-only anchor (the capture flash reports it), never a
      blocked mark.

    description: >
      On #/evals, select a VIDEO reading. On the detail workspace's MEDIA STAGE, read the custom player's
      control bar (`.an-bar`): does it carry a fullscreen control (`.an-fs`) alongside play/pause · scrubber
      · time? Read the button's glyph (must NOT be an emoji — an inline SVG icon) and its title/aria-label.
      Click it and read `document.fullscreenElement` — is it the player wrapper (`.an-player`, so the custom
      scrubber/controls are still on screen), not just the bare `<video>`? Read the button's title again
      (should flip to an exit label). Exit fullscreen (Esc) and confirm the element clears. Separately, on a
      plain `<video controls>` home (a node eval-tab gallery clip, or a thread blob link) confirm NO extra
      `.an-fs` is added — native controls already carry fullscreen (no doubled control).
    expected: |
      The custom review-track player — which SUPPRESSES native `<video>` chrome — carries an explicit
      fullscreen control in its bar (`.an-fs`), rendered as an inline corner-bracket SVG (house icon style),
      NO emoji glyph, with a 'fullscreen' title/aria-label. Clicking it calls requestFullscreen on the whole
      player wrapper (`.an-player` = stage + control bar), so in fullscreen the video fills the screen AND
      the custom scrubber/markers/time stay usable (keyboard scrubbing still drives it); the title flips to
      'exit fullscreen' and the icon to the inward-bracket variant. Esc exits and `document.fullscreenElement`
      clears. It is the ONE shared FullscreenButton (from Evidence.jsx), used ONLY where controls are
      suppressed: a plain `<video controls>` gets fullscreen from its own native chrome and grows NO second
      control — the fullscreen affordance is present on every video surface, never duplicated.

      On #/evals select an IMAGE reading. In the detail pane: read the image's cursor style, click it,
      measure the overlay image's rendered size against the viewport, press Esc and read the page hash;
      reopen, click the backdrop.
    expected: |
      The evidence image invites the zoom (cursor zoom-in). A click opens a fixed full-viewport lightbox
      showing the SAME blob near viewport size (max ~96vw/96vh — the pane's width is no longer the
      ceiling). Esc closes ONLY the lightbox — the page stays on #/evals, no page-level Esc handler
      fires; clicking anywhere on the overlay also closes it. Switching selection while open closes it.
  - name: eval-comments
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    description: >
      On #/evals select an eval with no existing remark thread. In the detail workspace's remark rail:
      send a first comment; send a second; confirm the trunk store holds exactly ONE local issue for that
      concern — read it from the board overlay's `entry.thread` (or the store's git log), since
      /api/issues excludes eval concerns by construction — and that no row for it renders on #/issues;
      send a third containing '@new'. Read the overlay between sends.
    expected: |
      The first comment lazily CREATES a local issue bound by concern 'eval: <node> · <scenario>'
      (nodes:[node], the comment its first reply) and it renders in place in the rail's remark list. The
      second comment APPENDS to that same thread — the store holds exactly ONE local issue with that
      concern (no duplicate thread), now with two replies, both carried by the board overlay's
      `entry.thread`. The thread IS a real local issue (store local, concern-keyed) but — after the
      eval-remark read-time split — it is EXCLUDED from the merged issue list server-side (/api/issues'
      mergedIssues drops isEvalConcern); it surfaces only under its eval, never as an Issues-page row.
      The '@new' comment dispatches a fresh worker through the same write path — the one-line outcome
      ('@ new→<session>') echoes on the page.

      On #/evals, select a reading and unfold the remark rail. In the rail composer's action row read the
      `@`, `[[`, and `/` symbol buttons (aria-labels/tooltips). Seed a draft, place the caret mid-draft,
      click `@` and read the textarea's value/focus/selectionStart and any open menu; Esc, select a span,
      click `[[` and re-read; Esc, put the caret at a line start, click `/`, and read the review menu.
      Confirm no remark was posted, then re-read the row's child geometry at desktop and at a ~780px
      window. Open an issue reply composer and confirm its action row still has only the reference buttons.
    expected: >-
      The shared Thread composer carries `@` and `[[` discoverability buttons on every home; the eval rail,
      which supplies review commands, adds the compact `/` button while an issue composer does not. Each
      inserts its EXACT trigger at the caret/selection, preserves the rest of the draft, and refocuses with
      the caret right after the trigger. The ONE shared autocomplete opens upward for `@`/`[[`; from a
      command-eligible line start `/` opens the ONE shared review menu. No second menu, dispatch, or post.
      Localized aria-label + shared `data-tip` on all applicable buttons. At desktop and ~780px the row
      (triggers, ⏱ where a clip supplies one, Send) fits without overlap. No page errors.

      On #/evals, select a scenario that has MORE THAN ONE reading — a fail (A) followed by a pass (B). In
      the detail workspace's HEADER band, read the A/B strip's verdict pips and the position label; click
      the older (fail) pip (or press ‹) and read the header verdict badge, the expected/note text, and
      which evidence blob the media points at; then click the newest (pass) pip and read them again. Read
      the rail's remark thread before and after the flips.
    expected: |
      The A/B strip rides the slim header band (right-aligned), one verdict pip per reading,
      oldest→newest, ✗ for a fail (an A pole) and ✓ for a pass (a B pole), the viewed pip outlined.
      Flipping to the older reading lights its ✗ pip, sets the
      header badge to ✗, and swaps the media/expected/note IN PLACE to that reading's (a different blob hash
      than the latest); flipping back to the newest lights the ✓ pip, badge ✓, media back to the latest,
      and the position label reads 'latest'. The strip is absent for a single-reading scenario. The eval's
      remark thread (bound by concern 'eval: <node> · <scenario>') is IDENTICAL across both flips — it is
      per-scenario, not per-reading, so the annotation track spans the whole A/B.

      On #/evals, select a video reading whose LATEST reading carries a `by` (the session that filed it)
      that is an ONLINE board session. In the detail workspace's HEADER band, read the filer pill
      (`.fv-originator`): the originator id, its alive/offline class, the dot's computed colour, and the
      title (which must read as an EVAL, not an issue), whether the ONLINE filer is a click target, and
      whether the old reach phrase is absent. Confirm a reading with no `by` (a legacy reading) shows no
      filer chip.
    expected: |
      The header surfaces the FILER — the session that filed the viewed scenario's latest reading (from
      `evalTimeline`'s per-reading `by`) — with a liveness dot and no visible reach phrase: an ONLINE filer
      reads `alive`, uses a status-hued dot from the board's `STATUS_COLOR`, renders as a clickable chip,
      and clicking it opens `#/sessions/<id>` with that session selected. An absent/offline filer reads
      `offline`, uses the muted dot, and is not clickable. The title names it an EVAL, the same shared
      `OriginatorLiveness` the issues header uses, distinct only in wording. A legacy reading with no `by`
      resolves to nobody and the header simply shows no filer chip. No second palette, no page errors.

      Against a backend on a disposable store, seed one AGENT-authored remark (CLI `spex remark`, a real
      session id) and one HUMAN-authored remark (POST /api/remarks) on the SAME (node, scenario). Open
      #/evals, select that scenario's reading, and read the rail's remark rows: which verb button each
      carries. Click resolve on the agent's remark and re-read its row; click retract on the human's own
      and re-read the thread.
    expected: >-
      Each unresolved remark row carries exactly ONE verb, mirroring the server's teeth: the agent's
      remark a `resolve` button (the human's second-party judgment — never offered on the human's own),
      the human's own a `retract`. Resolve flips the row in place to settled (dimmed, "✓ resolved", the
      resolver in its title) and the verb disappears — monotonic, a resolved remark is immutable. Retract
      REMOVES the human's own row from the thread. Both writes ride the CLI-parity
      /api/remarks/resolve|retract with the `<thread-id>#<rid>` ref in the BODY; a refused action
      surfaces its server message on the row, never swallowed. No page errors.

      In a real browser open a SESSION's console Eval tab (not #/evals) for a session whose worktree has
      filed an in-session VIDEO reading on a scenario the MAIN checkout still scores with an OLDER,
      different reading (e.g. an image). The row shows the in-session reading (vid·…). Select it and read
      the detail: how many <video> elements mount (`.an-video`); whether the media shown is the in-session
      video or the older main-checkout still; whether the A/B strip's newer (›) control can reach the
      current reading. Contrast with the same row on the #/evals page (main-rooted).
    expected: |-
      The session Eval tab is WORKTREE-rooted end to end: selecting an in-session video row opens THAT
      reading — its <video> mounts on the stage (`.an-video` present, video count ≥ 1) and the A/B strip
      shows the in-session reading as the latest (the › newer control disabled AT it, not short of it).
      The detail is NEVER the older main-checkout reading: the pane must not re-fetch the main
      `/api/specs/:id/evals` timeline (which lacks the un-merged in-session reading) and strand the
      current video behind an inherited still with the newer-nav disabled. The A/B history is
      home-provided — the session tab hands EventDetail its already-computed worktree readings, so the
      walk reflects the session's branch; the #/evals page (main-rooted) still fetches its own timeline.

      Select a reading carrying BOTH a clip/still AND a structured `data` entry (a vid·img·data reading). On

      HIDDEN (checkVisibility=false) until the header is clicked — then shown? Then compare a data-ONLY
      reading's block.
    expected: |-
      When the reading also carries primary media (video/still), the structured `data` renders as a native
      <details> FOLDED to just its "STRUCTURED DATA (JSON)" header (a ▸ marker), the JSON hidden
      (checkVisibility=false) so it never pushes the clip/gallery off the stage; clicking the header opens it
      (▾ + the pretty-printed block). A data-ONLY reading renders the block OPEN (it IS the evidence). Only
      the `data` kind folds — a transcript is unaffected — and the fold is native HTML, no JS state.

      styles: the `.fv-compose` container's border/radius, the textarea's computed border-style and idle
      height, the action row's idle presence and contents (every control's accessible name), whether any
      always-visible hint text renders, and — on the eval detail — whether the header band carries any
      human-ok WRITE button. Type `@` and `/` and read where the menus open relative to the composer.
      Repeat both pages at a NARROW desktop width (~780px — under the 900px stacked-workspace
      breakpoint, above the phone app's 640px takeover) and check for overlap or clipped text around
      the composer.

      ONE shared composer shape on both homes: a quiet bordered rounded container holding a BORDERLESS
      writing surface (computed border-style none) floored at TWO lines idle (~40px, never a one-line
      sliver), over a PERSISTENT compact action row. The row carries only real SpexCode acts — the
      `@`/`[[` trigger-insert buttons ([[mentions]] discoverability, on every home), the `/` trigger on
      the eval rail where review commands are armed, ⏱ anchor on that clip composer, Promote/Close issue
      on an open issue — and an ICON-ONLY Send
      (an SVG glyph with an aria-label/tooltip, no bare unlabeled icon) pinned at the row's right edge;
      none of the reference app's tools (attach, web, model pickers …) appear. NO always-visible hint
      line ('@session to summon · [[node]] to link' is gone) — while the `@`/`[[` autocomplete and the
      `/` command menu still open, as overlays ABOVE the composer container, never inside or under it.
      The eval header carries NO standalone human-ok button — the typed /ok is the only dashboard door,
      and an ok'd reading shows only the settled ☑ mark. At the narrow width both composers keep the
      same shape with no overlapping controls and no clipped text. No page errors.

# event-detail loss

YATU through the real browser over a real backend: the workspace geometry (stage + rail both on screen,
no ping-pong), the seek, the ⏱ anchor, the circled-frame comment (its frame on /api/evidence and the
thread's evidence[]), the anchor-chip seek, the @new dispatch, and the absence of verdict-filing controls
are all read from live surfaces (DOM, /api/issues) — never asserted from the component code. There is ONE
annotation primitive (an anchored comment on the eval's thread); the pane reads readings, it files none.
