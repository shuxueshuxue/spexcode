// @@@ socket-level connection reaper ([[spec-cli]]) - the ONE mechanism that reaps abandoned sockets (the
// 135-conn starvation that wedged the public port and triggered the mass-restore cascade), and the SINGLE
// OWNER of the deadlines it enforces. Node's own `headersTimeout`/`keepAliveTimeout` cover the same phases
// (pre-request, idle-between-requests) and so are a second mechanism racing this one: MEASURED (eval
// server-reaps-abandoned-connections, issue #65) a `headersTimeout: 20000` set beside the reaper won the
// race on every reap at default config and silently capped SPEXCODE_REAP_HEADER_MS above 20s — the knob
// went dead while the close still looked timely (Node's 408, not the reaper's destroy). So install()
// DISABLES those overlapping Node timeouts on the server it guards; this helper is an explicit per-socket
// deadline at the server boundary, with no platform machinery shadowing it.
//
// It keys on "no request has completed yet / idle between requests" — never on response DURATION — so a
// long-lived ESTABLISHED stream (the /api/graph/stream SSE, a terminal WebSocket upgrade) is exempt for as
// long as it streams. The lifecycle per socket:
//   - on socket birth: arm the HEADER deadline — the socket must produce a fully-parsed request within it,
//     else it is a slow-loris and gets destroyed.
//   - on 'request' (headers complete → the request is in flight): disarm. An active request/response is
//     never reaped, however long its body/response takes (a slow board build or a streaming SSE response).
//   - when the response finishes/closes and no request is left in flight: re-arm the IDLE deadline (the
//     keep-alive window). Another request disarms it again; silence past it reaps the idle keep-alive socket.
//   - on 'upgrade' (WebSocket): mark exempt permanently — a persistent bidirectional stream, not a request
//     that ever "completes".
//
// WHICH socket the deadline lives on is load-bearing. On a TLS server (the public gateway) 'connection'
// fires with the RAW TCP socket, but every 'request'/'upgrade' reports the wrapping TLSSocket — a deadline
// armed on the raw socket is unreachable from request handling, never disarms, and destroys every TLS
// connection at the header deadline no matter how alive it is (MEASURED, eval
// stream-survives-public-gateway: the dashboard's actively-pinging SSE + terminal WS through the https
// gateway died every ~30s — the "reconnecting…" storm). So per-socket state is keyed on the socket requests
// actually report: the TLSSocket (born at 'secureConnection') on a TLS server, the plain socket elsewhere.
// The raw pre-handshake phase gets its own header-deadline guard (a TCP connect that never completes the TLS
// handshake is the same slow-loris one layer down), linked raw→TLS by the connection's addr:port 4-tuple —
// public API only, no reliance on Node's private TLSSocket internals.
//
// The child's reaped close propagates back through the supervisor's raw-TCP proxy (which pairs socket
// halves), so a reaped upstream frees its public-side socket too — no separate raw timeout on the proxy,
// which would blind it to a legitimately-idle WS/SSE.
