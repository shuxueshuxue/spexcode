desc: The dashboard's ONE issues page — the Forum route (#/forum, [[side-nav]]) as a MASTER-DETAIL — a left list (evals leading, merged issues below) and a full-height detail pane the selection drives; markdown-rendered bodies, node chips focus the graph, local writes in the detail, forge items link out.

# issues-view

## raw source

Issues are one object over every store ([[issues]]), and a human wants **one place** to read them — an
agent's local taste proposal and a GitHub issue on the same node belong on the same page, not on two
surfaces the user must correlate. So the dashboard carries ONE **Forum page** for them, a top-level page
of its own. The dashboard stays a **thin window** over the CLI's truth, never a second source —
it renders what `/api/issues` returns and computes nothing, and every write goes through the SAME
reply/propose the CLI uses, committed straight to the trunk.

## expanded spec

- **Entries — the forum is its OWN page.** The page lives at `#/forum` with its own [[side-nav]] rail
  entry — bookmarkable, reloadable, a peer of the graph and the session board. The keyboard doors are
  [[side-nav]]'s global ⌥ vocabulary — **⌥F / ⌥3** reach it from any page, the console included — plus
  the board's bare **`f` key** ([[keyboard-nav]]'s declarative keymap table, rebindable) as the direct
  jump from the graph. There is no console pill and no page-local shortcut anymore: one page, the shared
  doors. Esc never leaves the page ([[side-nav]]) — it stays with the page's own stack; going elsewhere
  is the rail, ⌥digit, or history.
- **The page is a MASTER-DETAIL — a full page deserves a full-height detail, never an expansion inside a
  box.** (The earlier pinned-two-region form was conceived for a height-starved overlay; on a routed
  full page it collapsed content into a small scrolling box — the human called it, and the form
  changed.) The **left column** is TWO BOUNDED regions — the [[evals-feed]] group leading (evals outrank
  issues: position expresses it) sizes to content but CAPS at ~half the column and scrolls itself; the
  merged issue group takes the rest and is **always on screen** — many evals can never bury it (the
  pinning law, applied to the list column where it belongs). Each group head is sticky within its own
  scroller and carries its own controls (the evals chips; New + the concluded-count chip). The
  **right pane** is the full-height DETAIL of the one selection — **selection IS detail** (email-style,
  no Enter, no in-place expansion): an issue renders its markdown body, an eval renders as the
  [[annotator]]. **j/k walk the whole left list across both groups** and the detail follows; a key typed
  into an input is never captured. The section contents are their own nodes (children of this one, owned
  by the video-verification line); this node owns the page shell — the split, the row grammar, the
  selection, and the j/k routing.
- **One merged list, store-tagged — RESIDENT, never cold-fetched.** The list is app-held state beside the
  board (one data path): the page renders instantly from it on every visit; freshness inherits the
  board's own pattern — the push/change signal triggers a throttled refetch, the 15s cold lane backstops
  (forge-cache updates arrive nowhere else), and `GET /api/issues` answers **304 via ETag** so a no-change
  refetch costs headers only. A write forces the refetch so it shows up where it lands. The view renders
  each issue **in the order the API returns**: the frontend
  never re-sorts, and **shows no salience/priority ranking** (recurrence is the drain's judgment, per
  [[proposals]], never an automatic order); signer and reply counts appear as raw data, not a rank.
  **Concluded issues hide by default** — closed / rejected / landed are the archive, not the open work,
  and mixing them in only confuses review; a count chip reveals them on demand (open and accepted stay:
  accepted is approved-but-not-landed, still live). An
  issue's ROW is one compact line — store chip, concern, status, reply count; its DETAIL carries the full
  header (status, author, signer count, node chips, permalink) over the **markdown-rendered body and
  replies** — the same SpecBody renderer the spec panes use, so forum markdown and spec markdown read as
  one dialect (raw `##`/table pipes never show). Store never changes the shape, only two affordances: a
  **local** issue's detail takes a reply; a **forge** issue carries its permalink and is discussed on the
  forge — read here, written there.
- **Node chips focus the graph.** An issue's node chips are clickable — a click routes to the graph page
  and **focuses that node**, so the page stays anchored to the graph it discusses.
- **A human writes from here — to the local store.** A local issue's detail carries a **reply composer**
  (a textarea + Send); the issue group's head carries a **New** affordance that opens a fresh local issue
  (a one-line concern, optional `[[node]]` links, an optional body). Both POST to
  `/api/issues` ([[proposals]]'s `forumReply`/`forumPost`, author `'human'`) — the SAME reply/propose the
  CLI uses, committed straight to the trunk — then reload so the new post shows. The write is a thin
  wrapper: the dashboard adds no store of its own, and it never writes to a forge ([[issues]]: v1 writes
  are local-only). A `@session` in the text **dispatches** ([[mentions]]) exactly as a CLI post would — a
  human summons an agent from the issues page — and the returned one-line dispatch summary is echoed
  briefly. A plain textarea with a `@session · [[node]]` hint is enough; autocomplete is optional.
- **Honors the switch.** When the forum workflow is OFF (`enabled: false`, [[proposals]]'s toggle), the
  view shows a muted "off" state instead of the list — the dashboard reflects the one source of truth,
  never forks it.
