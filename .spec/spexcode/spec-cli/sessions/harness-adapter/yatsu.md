  - name: codex-apply-patch-triggers-spec-hooks
    description: >-
      Through a REAL codex session (live exec/TUI, not a synthetic payload), make the agent (a) READ a code file
      via a shell command and (b) EDIT a code file via apply_patch. Codex sends the edit as its OWN tool
      `tool_name:"apply_patch"` whose `tool_input.command` is the bare patch envelope (`*** Update File: <path>`)
      — no `file_path`, no literal `apply_patch` token. Observe the global session dir's spec-first sentinel and
      spec-of-file ledger.
    expected: >-
      The adapter's shell mirror (`hp_code_path` accepting `apply_patch|Bash`, mutation keyed off the `*** … File:`
      markers) maps BOTH the Bash read and the apply_patch edit to the touched path: spec-first fires on the first
      code access (read OR an edit-first session), and spec-of-file records the EDITED path in its ledger —
      identical user-observable behaviour to a Claude user's Read/Edit. The failure this locks: when the edit
      tool/envelope is not mapped, spec-of-file and edit-first spec-first go SILENTLY INERT on codex while Bash
      reads still work, so a synthetic Bash-only test passes green and the regression hides — it must be measured
      through the real apply_patch round-trip. SECOND, ATTRIBUTION: because design C's hooks fire from the SHARED
      app-server (env carries NO `SPEXCODE_SESSION_ID`), `hp_session_id` lands on the codex THREAD id, so the
      sentinel/ledger AND mark-active's re-flip must reach the SpexCode-id GOVERNED record resolved via the
      thread-id→`harness_session_id` alias (`hp_store_dir`), NOT a phantom `<runtime>/sessions/<thread-id>` dir.
      The failure this locks: without the alias the writes silently target a non-existent dir and the board never
      sees the codex session flip to `active` / `asking`, while the agent's explicit `spex session` calls (run in
      the TUI pane, which DOES carry the env) still work — so the loss hides unless measured from a real hook.

  - name: codex-delivery-steers-midturn-and-resumes
    description: >-
      Through a REAL codex session on the project app-server, exercise the adapter's deliver + resume. (a) While
      the agent is MID-TURN (an `inProgress` turn — a long-running tool call), `spex session send` a message and
      watch the codex pane: the model must react WITHIN the same running turn, not after it stops. (b) While the
      agent is IDLE, send again — it must still land. (c) Kill the tmux window and `reopen`: the relaunched TUI
      must show the SAME prior conversation (unchanged captured thread id), not a blank new thread.
    expected: >-
      deliver reads the live thread (`thread/read{includeTurns}`) and chooses `turn/steer` when a turn is
      `inProgress` — the injected message lands mid-turn (the agent acknowledges it while its background command
      is still running, reporting a step SHORT of the final one) and the turn continues — and `turn/start` when
      idle (the message still lands). The failure this locks: always `turn/start` QUEUES a busy agent's message
      until the current turn ends, so a human's mid-turn steer is silently delayed instead of injected "right
      after the running tool call completes". `reopen` relaunches `codex resume <captured-thread-id>` so the
      prior conversation is present and `harness_session_id` is unchanged — the SAME conversation, matching
      claude's `--resume`, not a fresh thread.

# yatsu.md — harness-adapter

The adapter's whole job is that the user-facing spec hooks ([[spec-first]], [[spec-of-file]], mark-active) behave
identically whichever harness the user runs. The load-bearing, easy-to-miss divergence is codex's **two-tool code
model** — a shell read is `tool_name:"Bash"`, but an edit is a distinct `tool_name:"apply_patch"` carrying the bare
patch envelope — which a synthetic Bash-only payload does not exercise (the first cut shipped green against synthetic
Bash and was inert on real apply_patch edits). So this is measured the YATU way: through a real codex session that
actually edits via apply_patch, comparing the spec-of-file ledger + spec-first sentinel to the Claude baseline. The
trust / zero-prompt-launch half of the adapter is measured by [[harness-delivery]]'s `self-launch-zero-friction-codex`.

The adapter's OTHER user-observable behaviour is **prompt delivery**: the dashboard input must reach a live codex
session the way a human expects — injected INTO the running turn when the agent is busy (steer), not parked behind it.
That is a separate code slice (`harness.ts`'s app-server JSON-RPC), so it carries its own scenario and stales
independently of the shell-mirror payload parse. It too is measured the YATU way — a real codex session driven busy,
steered mid-turn through the real `spex session send` surface, then killed and `reopen`ed to prove the conversation
resumes — never a synthetic socket stub, which would prove only that bytes were written, not that codex acted.
