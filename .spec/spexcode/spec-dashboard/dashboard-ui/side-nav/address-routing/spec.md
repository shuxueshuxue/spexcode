desc: A single dashboard address vocabulary for clickable references — graph nodes, sessions, issues, and evals — projected to canonical hash URLs and executed through one navigation helper.

# address-routing

Clickable references in the dashboard name a product object first and a route second. A search row, a
FocusPanel scenario, an IssueCard, or any future node/session/review reference should all produce the same
small **app address** shape, then let the shared address layer project it to the canonical destination.

The vocabulary is intentionally closed and mirrors the top-level pages [[side-nav]] already owns:

- `graph-node` focuses a node on `#/graph`; the focused id is shell view state, not a hash segment.
- `session` opens `#/sessions/<id>`.
- `session-eval` opens `#/sessions/<id>/eval[/<node>/<scenario>]` — the console with the **Eval tab**
  active, optionally landed on one scenario's in-session reading ([[session-eval]]). This is the address an
  MR/CI note pastes so a reviewer one-clicks into the live, remarkable reading of an un-merged branch — and
  it is a **persistent, refreshable** sub-route, NOT a one-shot entrance normalized away: the Eval tab and
  the deep-linked reading stay in the hash while that session's tab is the one showing, so a reload reopens
  the same reading and the pasted link stays shareable. Switching to another session tab drops the sub-route
  back to the bare `#/sessions/<id>`; the deep link is preserved only for its own session's tab. The
  sub-route's URL shape has ONE encoder (`route.sessionEvalParam`): the href side (`addressHash`) and the
  console's tab-echo both go through it, so the link a reviewer copies and the hash a reload restores are the
  same string — there is no second, bespoke session-eval route grammar.
- `issue` opens `#/issues/<issue-id>` and lets [[issues-view]] select the detail.
- `eval` opens `#/evals/<node>/<scenario>` and lets [[evals-view]] select the detail — the TRUNK-rooted
  timeline; a not-yet-merged session reading's address is `session-eval`, not this.

`addressHash(address)` is the href side: real anchors and copyable links get the canonical hash without
hand-rolled string assembly in components. `navigateAddress(address, callbacks)` is the SPA side: it follows
the same projection, with callbacks only for shell-owned state (`graph-node` focus and session tab selection).
Consumers may choose button or anchor chrome, but they do not decide the route vocabulary. That keeps review
objects first-class: issue and scenario references land on their owning review pages, never by accident on
the bound spec node or a node-popup tab.
