# node-graph

A **drill-down** tidy-tree of the spec-node neighbourhood: navigate by **relationship**, not by hunting a full forest where siblings blur into cousins. Only the focused node's **ancestor spine is expanded** — every other subtree collapses to a single tile — so the **root layer is always a short, readable column** no matter how deep or bushy the real tree is. (A point-per-node tidy tree otherwise spends vertical space equal to its *leaf count*, sprawling the high-level nodes — the ones you most want to grasp together — worst.) The tree **re-plots as focus moves** and the **camera follows focus**, keeping it centred while its neighbourhood expands and collapses around it. Layout is horizontal left→right: depth is the column (root at the left), siblings stack as rows, parents centre over their children, tiles never touch, and edges read bold when they touch the focus, faint otherwise. A **collapsed node** (children hidden) carries a small **`▸N` tab on its right edge** naming its hidden direct-child count, so a leaf and a closed branch never look alike; it picks up the focus colour on the focused node. Keys follow the same relationships (see [[keyboard-nav]]): ←/→ drill out/in, ↑/↓ walk siblings in the focused column.

Each node is a tight **two-row tile** — not a card — so the whole tree fits one screen; a reader sees at a glance both *what this node is* and *who/when*.

**Row 1 — identity:** `status dot · title · version` plus overlay marks. The tile's `node-dot` (the session-row face has no dot — it leads with its avatar) shows the backend-**derived** four-state (see [[spec-node-states]]): green merged, orange active (pulsing), yellow drift (with a commits-ahead `⚠N` badge), grey pending. A worktree's pending ops stamp glyphs in the author session's colour — `+` added, `~` edited, `✕` deleted, `→` moved — with a dashed ring while uncommitted; an `added`-only node draws as a translucent ghost.

**Row 2 — people & recency:** a node's *live editors* are the sessions whose pending ops currently touch it (the live overlay, never the historical `session` trailer). With editors, one **avatar** each ringed by liveness and capped with `+N`; with none, it falls back to **"last edited … ago"**, or "no versions yet" when there is no committed history.

**Avatars** are deterministic, generated from the session id (the dashboard has no real accounts). Rendering is a **pluggable provider seam**: a higher-priority provider registered later (e.g. id → real image) swaps every face with no change to the node renderer.

**One colour system.** A session's avatar face and its *labelling colour* — node ring/overlay, the reparent edge, the session-row stripe — derive from the SAME hash of the SAME seed (the session id), so a session's face and every mark that names it share one hue. The backend emits a stable `seed` per worktree (its live session id, else its path); the dashboard derives the colour.

A `moved` overlay carrying `toParent` draws a **faint dashed arrow** to the node's proposed new parent, in the author session's colour, so a human SEES the reparent before it merges — overlaid on, never replacing, the solid tree edges.

Because this vocabulary is dense, a **floating legend** decodes it on demand (`?` toggles, Esc closes), reading its swatches from the SAME constants the nodes render from so it can never drift. The legend and the [[settings]] popup share one centered-modal chrome (`Modal.jsx`). `styles.css` is the dashboard's **shared stylesheet**: other surfaces add classes to it — the yatsu eval tab's `.eval-verdict`/`.eval-transcript` rules from the measure-and-score reframe are the latest — so its growth is those features, not this tree's rules.

The board and the session console are **bidirectionally linked**: live editors map to live sessions by exact id, driving Row 2's avatars (see [[session-console]]); clicking a session row focuses its first changed node, and nodes with no live editor focus on click.
