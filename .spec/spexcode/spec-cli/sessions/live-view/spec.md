# live-view

The dashboard's **live terminal** is a browser view of a session's tmux pane over one WebSocket per session:
server→client is raw pane bytes; the human never *types* into the view (prompts travel out-of-band — see
[[dispatch]]). The one thing that does travel client→server besides a resize is the **wheel** — navigation,
not input — so a full-screen TUI can scroll its own history (see scrolling below). A genuine tmux client, not
an output tap.

## the bridge

Behind each session is exactly **one** real tmux client *per backend instance*, shared by every viewer of
that instance — one authoritative pane size, never a size-fight (see the size vote below for how that
survives a second instance on the same socket). That client is a **control-mode connection**
(`tmux -C attach-session`): it speaks tmux's line protocol, so the client↔tmux boundary is an **event stream,
not a poll loop** — bytes are *pushed* as `%output` events and a resize is announced by a `%layout-change`.

**That client is transported over PIPES, never a pty** — a correctness requirement, not a preference.
Control mode *is* a line protocol, so a terminal buys the bridge nothing, while a pty master fd is **not
close-on-exec**: each client inherited every earlier client's master, so a killed bridge's pts outlived it
inside a live sibling and never hit `EIO` — tmux kept writing to a client that would never drain and its
**server's** event loop blocked forever in one `write(2)`, freezing every bridge on the socket at once
(every terminal black). Ordinary child stdio **is** close-on-exec, so a piped client inherits nothing and
the wedge has no mechanism; the bridge needs no native pty dependency at all. Two things follow. It is
`-C`, not `-CC` — the doubled flag only adds echo suppression, which *requires* a tty and emits the DCS
wrapper whose stripping once ate an OSC 8 terminator (below). And a pipe has no winsize, so a client states
its own size with the same `refresh-client -C` used everywhere else: **one** mechanism for size, no
terminal side-channel.

**The whole control stream is parsed as bytes — never a string round-trip.** The client's stdout hands the
bridge **raw Buffers**; it splits lines on the newline **byte**, un-escapes `%output` at the byte level, and broadcasts the
pane's **raw UTF-8 bytes** verbatim (the `capture-pane` seed is joined and framed at the byte level too). This
is the whole fix for intermittent `�` corruption: a UTF-8 decode at the transport chops the stream on OS-read
boundaries, so a wide character (CJK, box-drawing, emoji) straddling two reads becomes a U+FFFD **before the
bridge ever sees it**, unrecoverable. Byte-splitting is safe because tmux escapes only the C0 controls and
backslash as octal `\NNN` (all `< 0x80`) and passes high bytes through **raw**, and a newline never falls
inside a multi-byte character — so each wide char stays whole in one line, and un-escaping (each `\NNN` → its
one byte, all else untouched) yields the pane's exact UTF-8 with no decode/encode cycle to shatter it.

Byte-verbatim covers **escapes that end a captured row**. A pane row can end in `\x1b\\` as the ST closing an
**OSC 8 hyperlink** (which Claude Code emits for URLs and xterm renders underlined); eating it leaves the link
unterminated, so xterm never closes it and underlines the **rest of the screen** — the "whole terminal goes
underlined when I scroll" glitch. Nothing can eat it now: `-C` emits no DCS wrapper, so the bridge strips
nothing and every line — protocol or `capture-pane` body — keeps its terminators. The glitch came from a
wrapper that only exists to let a control stream share a real terminal; on a dedicated pipe the whole class
is gone rather than avoided.

**Resize is deterministic and timer-free.** `refresh-client -C WxH` is guaranteed to emit exactly one
`%layout-change` — even a same-size no-op emits one — so the bridge sets the size, then **waits to be told**
it re-wrapped by that event, which is a mathematical certainty of arrival, not a hope. Crucially the wait
accepts **whatever size the event announces**, never an exact match on the size that was asked: every
viewer, peek, and warm client is its own control client sharing ONE window under `window-size latest`, so
the converged size is routinely another client's — an exact-size wait deadlocks the attach seed forever
(the full-frame flag latches, mode flips get dropped, `%output` stays frozen: a mute black terminal). For
the same reason a mode flip **always** repaints (the repaint token dedups), and an *unsolicited* geometry
change — another client resized the shared window with no repaint in flight — re-seeds the viewers rather
than letting live deltas paint onto stale geometry. No settle-timeout, no geometry poll, no per-repaint
pull; a repaint whose size already equals the known layout paints at once.

That repaint is the viewer's **one writer** from the resize request until its reconstructed frame lands.
Resizing sends `SIGWINCH` to the pane, so a TUI commonly emits a top-to-bottom redraw as several `%output`
events before `capture-pane` answers. Broadcasting those events and then the capture made the browser show
the redraw as a terminal-wide scroll before replacing it with the coherent frame. The bridge now holds those
pre-frame events back: the capture already includes every event before its command boundary, then the frame
lands once and ordinary `%output` resumes as the live tail. No debounce or settle timer is involved, and the
same ownership covers first-visible, resize, reconnect, mode change, and copy-mode repaint.

## the size vote — sharing the socket with other instances

The window-size rules above assume every client on the socket is *this* backend's. They aren't: a second
backend instance (a worktree's test `spex serve` on the same box) attaches its own bridges to the same tmux
sessions, and its viewer-less clients would assert their cold default on any repaint — collapsing the
terminal a human is watching on the main instance, unreclaimably (the watched bridge's counter-assert is a
same-client-size no-op). So window size is a **vote**, arbitrated by tmux's `ignore-size` client flag:

- **Every bridge client starts size-NEUTRAL** (flagged) and **votes only while a viewer has SIZED it** — a
  visible connect or a resize, never a hidden board-load connect. Last viewer gone → neutral again.
- The flag means "yield while any unflagged client is attached" — **server-wide**, and **void when all
  clients are flagged** (then everyone counts again). That fallback is what keeps a lone backend's warm
  hold working; the server-wide scope is why a warm hold anywhere is *deferred* while anyone votes.
- The flag rides an **in-stream command**, not an attach-time `-f`, so a pre-3.2 tmux degrades to a
  harmless `%error` (the old size-fight behaviour) instead of a client that cannot attach.
- A **suppressed** `refresh-client -C` still receives its one `%layout-change` (measured — announcing the
  window's real size), so the deterministic wait and the accept-any-announced-size rule hold on both sides
  of the flag. Two instances with *live sized viewers* on one session still converge latest-wins, as ever.

A supervisor keeps a **warm** client for every *detached* live session — so a tab paints fast — and
**skips** any session a human is already attached to in their own terminal. A warm client is spawned at the
last-known viewer size (per session, then a global/fixed fallback) and then **left alone**: the supervisor
never re-sizes it off-screen. Window geometry is owned by **sized viewers alone** — a bare attach asserts
nothing and neutral clients yield, so between viewers a window simply keeps the last sized viewer's
geometry; there is no drift for an off-screen hold to correct, and the size-first handshake draws the next
first frame exact anyway. (The hold this replaces was measured to be a per-tick capture + full-frame
broadcast to every hidden pane of every unwatched session whenever anyone voted — its suppressed retry was
never the budgeted no-op.) So an unwatched warm bridge does **no periodic work at all**: no refresh-client,
no capture, no broadcast — a hidden pane's only idle traffic is the terminal socket's keep-alive ping.

## first-visible, not first-connect

Panes are **warm and always connected**: a viewer's socket opens when the board loads, while its pane is
still **hidden at 0×0**. So the first frame must be drawn at the size the pane will have **when the human
looks at it**, not at connect time. Two connect shapes:

- **Visible (re)connect** — the client measures its pane and carries its real size **on the connect URL**;
  the server sizes the bridge to it and draws that first frame correct. A reconnect re-resolves the size, so
  it too hands over the live one. This is the only path the connect-query serves.
- **Hidden connect** — 0×0, no size rides along. The server does **not** paint a guessed prewarm frame:
  undersized, and landing in a hidden buffer it would only be overpainted the instant the pane became
  visible — the old two-stage scramble. It **defers** the one first-frame paint — **purely** — to the client's
  **first resize**, which fires the moment the pane becomes visible at its true size. There is **no timer
  fallback**: a pane that never resizes is a pane no one ever looks at (the client sends its real size the
  instant the pane becomes visible), so it needs no frame. This is **fail-loud** — no size, no paint until the
  resize arrives — and it makes the whole first-paint path **event-driven and zero-timer**, matching the
  timer-free convergence above: the bridge holds not one time-based heuristic on either path.

The client mirrors this: the instant a hidden pane becomes visible it **fits and sends its real size at
once** — since that resize *is* what triggers the deferred first frame. The fit-retry stays the **corrective**
path for a size measured slightly wrong mid-animation.

The client is forced to **UTF-8** (`tmux -u` plus a UTF-8 `LANG`), independent of the host locale — else a
backend with an empty/non-UTF-8 environment (e.g. a macOS LaunchAgent) makes tmux substitute `_` for every
wide character, though the pane stores it correctly.

## the durable-subscription invariant

A viewer subscribes to a **stable session id**, never the bridge instance, so the subscription **outlives
any number of bridge deaths and respawns**: when the tmux client exits the bridge is replaced underneath and
surviving viewers are transparently re-bound and repainted **on the same open socket** — invisible to the
browser, so a live pane can never freeze and **client reconnection is unnecessary for bridge churn**. Re-bind
is owned by the supervisor's reconcile pass: **alive-gated** (a dead session is reaped rather than respawning
into a storm) and **rate-limited** (a flaky session can't fork-bomb tmux). The repaint on every (re)attach is
**fail-loud** — it must fire, since an idle re-bound pane has nothing else to re-arm it. The **only**
intentional socket close is the human closing the pane (the board flipping a session to `offline`); a backend
*process* restart is the lone genuine socket drop, recovered by a stateless reopen of the same endpoint ([[reconnect]]).

## coherence — a control-mode attach replays nothing, so a FULL frame reconstructs state

Control mode never replays a screen on its own — a bare attach and a plain refresh both emit nothing, and
(unlike a raw attach, where tmux resends the pane's whole terminal state) it never re-emits the alt-screen
switch or the app's mouse-tracking modes. So every (re)attach **seeds** its one coherent frame from the
**current tmux view at the converged size**, then lets the live output be the tail. The two stay coherent because tmux
serializes commands and notifications on one stream: the capture reflects the pane at its command boundary, so
any live output that follows lands *after* it and is never overwritten — the deterministic seed, not the banned
splice of a guessed-size snapshot into an already-flowing stream.

A frame is therefore a **complete reconstruction of the pane's terminal state** at the converged size — not
just its grid — because the live `%output` that follows renders *on top of* it and assumes the terminal is in
exactly that state. The capture carries only the grid; one builder wraps the rest of the state around it, in
five named pieces (stream order):

- **modes** — the alt-screen switch + mouse-tracking, reconstructed from the pane's live flags (`alternate_on`,
  the mouse flags). Only on a **full** frame (fresh (re)attach / re-bind, or the resize right after a viewer
  resets its xterm) — a plain resize keeps the modes the browser already holds, since control mode never
  re-emits them. So the browser mirrors the pane on the **alternate screen** for a full-screen TUI and in its
  **mouse-tracking mode**. That same pane-mode reading drives wheel routing below — reconstruction and
  navigation are one interpretation of tmux state, not two.
- **pen** — reset SGR + close any open OSC 8 hyperlink, so no attribute/hyperlink state leaks across the clear
  from the prior frame (xterm paints an unclosed hyperlink as a whole-screen underline).
- **clear** — a viewport-only clear (`\x1b[H\x1b[2J`, never the scrollback `\x1b[3J`), so it never re-floods
  history into a browser-owned scrollback.
- **grid** — the captured rows, joined at the byte level (a wide char / an OSC 8 ST is never string-mangled).
- **cursor** — placed where the pane **really** has it (`\x1b[y;xH` from `cursor_x`/`cursor_y`). A capture
  restores the grid but not the cursor, and a live inline TUI's next `%output` redraws **relative to the
  cursor** (Ink erases its previous frame by moving up from where it left off — the input line, *above* the
  trailing hint rows, not the body's end). Leaving the cursor at the body's end makes that redraw erase the
  wrong rows and **double the bottom UI** — the garble on **any** re-seed the TUI gets no SIGWINCH for
  (copy-mode exit, a **reconnect**, an unsolicited layout-change; a resize self-corrects, since its SIGWINCH
  triggers a full redraw). A fresh session on a deploy garbles this way without anyone scrolling.

Each of the three rendering bugs this node has carried was exactly **one missing piece** of that reconstruction
(a mangled grid byte, a leaked hyperlink, a dropped cursor); building the whole state in one place is the
architecture that keeps them all fixed and gives any future state a home.

## scrolling — the pane's real history, through tmux

The browser never decides which scroll mechanism owns the pane. It sends the wheel to the bridge, and the
bridge decides from tmux's live pane flags:

- **Normal-screen pane** (a shell, a log): its history lives in tmux's scrollback. Wheel-up enters tmux
  copy-mode and scrolls that tmux view; wheel-down continues in copy-mode until the bottom. Each move repaints
  the browser from tmux's current copy-mode window: the bridge reads tmux's `scroll_position` / pane height
  and captures that exact history slice, because tmux's plain `capture-pane` still describes the bottom screen
  rather than the copy-mode viewport. While copy-mode owns the view, live `%output` from the underlying grid is
  held back from viewers and repaint frames own the screen; exiting copy-mode snaps the browser back to the
  live bottom view. The freeze flag has one ordered writer — the repaint that read the pane — so racing mode
  flips cannot leave the live tail frozen by a stale reading. So the dashboard feels like a real tmux client
  rather than a page scrolling an xterm buffer. The browser xterm keeps no independent terminal scrollback/scrollbar.
- **Full-screen TUI** (alternate screen, owns the mouse — e.g. Claude Code): it keeps **no** scrollback in
  xterm to scroll, and scrolls *itself* on mouse input. So when the pane advertises SGR mouse reports, the
  bridge injects the matching wheel report into the pane (`send-keys`), so the **app scrolls its own real
  history**.

The socket still carries no keyboard input — the wheel is the one navigation exception — and neither path is
harness-specific. Claude Code and Codex differ only in the tmux flags their panes expose.
