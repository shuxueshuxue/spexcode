    description: >
      Run rehearsal.sh (co-located): it rebuilds a REAL 0.2.x adopter repo from this repo's own
      history (git archive of the v0.2.8 tag-commit, git init + commit, HOME redirected into the rig),
      runs the new CLI on it un-migrated (materialize, spec lint, eval lint), then runs
      `spex doctor --migrate` once and re-runs the whole chain — including a live execution of the
      migrated stop-gate.sh against a governed active session record.
    expected: >
      One `spex doctor --migrate` run brings the 0.2.x tree to a fully working 0.3.0 state:
      `spex spec lint` reports 0 errors, `spex eval lint` reports 0 malformed with the pre-migration
      readings visible again (no false eval-coverage gaps on nodes that had yatsu.md measurements),
      `spex materialize` succeeds, and the migrated stop-gate.sh — invoked through the real hook
      protocol with the new `spex internal` verbs — blocks an undeclared governed stop with the
      decision:block JSON. Un-migrated, the same chain must fail LOUDLY (materialize refuses, naming
      `spex doctor --migrate`), never silently.

      rehearsal.sh phase 2: build the same 0.2.x adopter but hand-edit one line of
      .config/core/stop-gate/stop-gate.sh before committing, then run `spex doctor --migrate`.
    expected: >
      The customized stop-gate.sh is FLAGGED for review ("differs from EVERY known stock template
      version") and left byte-identical — the hand edit survives; the migrator never silently
      rewrites an asset it cannot hash-match to a known stock version.

      rehearsal.sh phase 3: run `spex doctor --migrate` a second time on the already-migrated
      adopter repo.
    expected: >
      The second run REFUSES cleanly before any write — exit non-zero, "already migrated" named in
      the refusal, tree unchanged.

Measured YATU through the shipped CLI (`spex doctor --migrate` and the post-checks are the real product
surface an adopter operator runs), never by reasoning about the rewrite tables. The rig is
deterministic — the 0.2.8 tree comes from this repo's own immutable history — so a reading is
reproducible from any checkout: `bash rehearsal.sh`.
