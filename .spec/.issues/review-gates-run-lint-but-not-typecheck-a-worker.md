concern: review gates run lint but not typecheck — a worker landed a real TS2322 API-shape break (issues.ts closeIssue fed {as,already} into a string status field) through spex review's green gates, because tsx erases types at runtime and spex lint doesn't compile. The merge cockpit's gate set ([[sessions-core]]) should include (or at least surface) npx tsc --noEmit per touched package, so a type-contract break reads as a red gate at review time instead of surfacing later on main. Found while fixing the break (be558510).

Stays open past this session by design: it is backlog for whoever next touches the review cockpit — the gate-set addition (tsc --noEmit per touched package) needs its own node/worker; this session only proved the gap (a TS2322 landed through green gates, fixed in be558510).

按既定设计关闭:sessions.ts:1419-1420 明文'no build/typecheck/test gate——soundness 由节点的 eval scenarios 证明,gate 保持语言无关',ReviewGates 只含 {conflictsWithMain, lint}(1499)。这是拍板过的设计取舍而非缺口;TS2322 类破坏应由被触节点的 eval 场景接住。
