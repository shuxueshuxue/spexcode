# ci-gate

The dogfood ritual is advertised as "hook-enforced", but the git hooks are **advisory and per-clone**:
they live in `.git/hooks` (never committed), so a fresh checkout that skipped `npm run hooks` has *no*
gate — and nothing surfaces that gap. CLAUDE.md already names CI as the *real* gate; this node makes that
true instead of aspirational.

CI is the **non-bypassable** layer that runs on the forge, not on a developer's machine:

- **When** — every push to `main` and every pull request. A merge to `main` is therefore always checked,
  and a node branch is checked before it lands.
- **What** — the same two gates the manager weighs at review: **`spex lint`** (fails the build on
  *errors* — a broken spec↔code link or a changelog body; coverage and drift stay advisory warnings) and
  the **`tsc --noEmit`** type check on the CLI package. Full git history is fetched because lint derives
  the version timeline and drift from git.
- **Why a backstop and not the only gate** — the [[main-guard]] hook still gives fast *local* feedback and
  blocks direct commits on `main`; CI guarantees the [[spec-lint]] contract holds even when that hook is
  absent or bypassed (`SPEXCODE_SKIP_LINT=1`). Defense in depth: local is convenience, CI is the truth.

This governs only the workflow definition. The lint rules and the type contract themselves live with
[[spec-lint]] and the package nodes; CI is purely the thing that *runs* them where they cannot be skipped.
