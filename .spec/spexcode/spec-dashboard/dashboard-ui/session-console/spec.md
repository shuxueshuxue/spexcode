# session-console

## raw source

`Enter` on the board opens the session interface; the always-on top-right window (SessionWindow) is the
at-a-glance summary. Both are **thin views of `/api/board`** (i.e. `spex board`): the dashboard renders only
what the backend reports and never invents session state, so a human watching the dashboard and an agent
driving the same sessions through the CLI see identical state.

## expanded spec

The interface opens as a **near-fullscreen modal** over the dimmed, blurred board: it fills the viewport, but
a thin inset (the board still framing it), rounded corners, a float shadow, and a scale-in entrance keep the
**popup** mental model — it reads as floating over the app, never as a separate page.

The interface is two panes: a left session list and a right content area that **morphs** by what's focused.

**New Session** is a centred avatar + auto-growing input. Nothing is prefilled; the focused node is instead
the first **@-mention** suggestion, so the human opts into a target by typing `@` — a narrow, keyboard-first
dropdown of spec nodes. A leading **`/`** opens the config-preset palette; the
two compose the launch grammar
`/<preset> @<node>… <free text>` into one prompt, from which the server derives the session's node (the first
`@<id>`). Both menus are pure assistance — picking a row only inserts text; the human still launches. The New
tab's prompt deliberately has **no** `/` slash-command menu (that surface is reserved for our own presets).

An existing session shows its **live tmux terminal** (SessionTerm) with the **single human input** docked at
the bottom. The terminal is a **real tmux client but a pure read-only scrollable view** — the human never
types into it. Read-only governs **input, not extraction**: text still selects and copies, and the wheel
scrolls tmux's real pane history. Extraction is **terminal-like**: selecting and copying in the pane **never
steal keyboard focus** from the docked `❯` box, so a human grabs scrollback text mid-sentence and keeps
typing. The pane is **dark** (for the Claude Code TUI inside) and **scales to its panel**. A (re)joining
viewer gets a **single coherent full repaint**, never a snapshot spliced into the live stream — so
tab-switching never half-paints.

Human input has **two channels for two jobs**. The docked **`❯` box** is the *prompt* channel: submitting
dispatches the line through the **control socket** — never by typing into the pane — so it lands even while
tmux is in copy-mode. It **holds focus persistently**: interacting with panel chrome — clicking a tab
(even the already-active one), the list's empty space, or the header — never blurs it, so the human always
keeps a place to type. A left-click selection in the terminal is the one thing that takes focus away. The
panel also **suppresses the browser's native context menu entirely** (it would otherwise seize focus the
moment it opens), for a terminal-app feel; should a right-click still blur the box, focus is **restored** to
it. Together these keep the human's cursor in the input no matter where or how often they click. The box
**auto-grows upward** as its text wraps: it is anchored to the bottom and **overlays** the terminal's lower
edge as it gets taller, so it never pushes the terminal or shifts any sibling — the terminal keeps its exact
size and place. Growth is **capped at half the terminal's height**, where it finally scrolls; below the cap
there is no scrollbar. It wears the same `/` **slash-command completion** as the New
tab ([[term-input]]), here for CC's commands. The second channel is **nav mode**:
while on, the `❯` box is disabled and every keystroke is forwarded **raw** to the pane, so the human can drive
the agent's interactive TUI menus (`/model`'s list, …). Its trigger is **manual and authoritative** — a header
toggle (and `⌃/⌘+I`) enters/exits; a best-effort sniff only *suggests* it, never seizes keys. Exiting refocuses
the `❯` box; leaving the tab or going offline also exits, so keystrokes can never reach the wrong pane.

Terminals are **warm and always connected**: every live session's pane is mounted and its socket opened the
moment the board loads — never lazily on focus — and since the surface stays mounted whether or not the
console is open, the sockets stay live **even while it's closed**, so reopening reveals panes that were warm
all along. Switching tabs therefore **never loses your place** (socket and scroll survive), for **every** tab
including **New Session**, which only hides its pane, never unmounts it. Warmth is **state, not GPU**: only the
**visible** pane is GPU-accelerated, so opening many panes can't exhaust the browser's capped GPU contexts. The backend keeps a warm tmux client
per live session. List navigation lives at the
**window level**, so arrows walk the list regardless of what holds focus (xterm included). Header lifecycle
actions (relaunch / merge / close) follow the session's state; an offline session shows a
relaunch panel instead of a dead terminal. There is **no manual "request review"** — review is
**agent-proposed** at the stop-gate, so the header only surfaces actions a human still drives. The header also
shows the session's **originating prompt** — "what was this asked to do?" — as a single line that fills the
bar's width and reveals the **full text on hover**.

**SessionWindow** is the read-only glance: every session as a status dot with a pending-op count. It carries
**two gestures that mirror the graph**: a single click **locks** the board onto that session — its overlays
light, the rest grey, focus jumps to its first changed node, and a top-center banner names the grip and
points at `o`/`O` (see [[keyboard-nav]]) to walk just its changed nodes. A session with **no** pending
changes still locks, but the board stays un-greyed and the banner says there's nothing to show. A second
click releases — the locked row wears the same grip so row and dimmed graph read as one selection.
**Double-click opens that session's board**, the mouse parallel to `⏎`. The window and the interface share their dot-colour and
display-name from `session.js`, so a session reads the same on every surface.

The **interface's own tabs** (the Enter surface's left session list) render the **same shared `SessionRow`**
the window does — avatar · status dot · name · status · op tally (`+2 ~1 ✕1`) — so a tab reads IDENTICALLY to
the window (same status AND the same count, e.g. `review ~2`), not a divergent subset; each surface only
wraps that one face in its own button + handlers. They carry the window's two gestures **inverted for their context**: a **single click** switches
to the tab; a **double-click locks** that session and returns to the graph focused on its overlay — the same
`onPickSession` flow, called with toggle off so a double-click always *grips* (never releases). The
precondition is a node to focus: a session with no overlay just switches, the double-click a no-op beyond it.
