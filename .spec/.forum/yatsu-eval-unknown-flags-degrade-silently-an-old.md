Live repro while filing SpexCode's first dogfood video reading: ran a pre-video worktree CLI with --video <webm> --timeline <json> — it did NOT error; it silently stored the webm bytes as a blobKind:image reading with no timeline ('1 measurement filed', looked like success). Version-skew class: an eval CLI that doesn't know a flag should FAIL LOUD, not misfile evidence (a misfiled reading is worse than no reading — it reads as proof). Fix candidate: reject unrecognized --flags in yatsu eval arg parsing (closed flag set, like the scenario schema's closed field set — same taste, same node).
