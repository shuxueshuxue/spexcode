# work-pane

## raw source

The spec and the terminal are one act split in two — the spec is the *intent*, the terminal is where you
*change it in place*. Originally they shared one pop-out `work` pane, two columns (spec left for reading,
terminal right for the work), so intent and the surface that changes it sat side by side in a fixed-size
panel that never grows to xterm's measured width.

## expanded spec

The node popup is the `i` surface: a fixed pop-out (`min(900px,90vw) × min(600px,84vh)`) with tabs, opened
over the board and dismissed with `Esc`. It is **reference-only** (`NodeView.jsx`) — no `work` pane, no
embedded terminal — and it is a **lens on the focus, not a pinned document**: the popup renders whichever
node currently holds board focus (keyed to it, remounting on change), so a focus move while it is open —
[[keyboard-nav]]'s Shift+nav walk — swaps the reference in place instead of forcing close-move-reopen; that
is how a run of sibling docs is read. Across such a move the **pane selection survives**: the new node opens
on the pane being read, and only when it lacks that pane does the popup fall back to the node's *own*
default — the first of its real tabs — which is exactly what keeps the edit-leads rule below intact (a
mid-change node greets with its edit tab even if the previous node was showing spec). The intent half is
the **spec doc** — an information board. A **stat bar** carries the
node's at-a-glance signals, the same the tile speaks: derived **status**, **version**, the aggregate **eval
score** ([[eval-score-badge]]), and the **drift** count when a governed file outran the spec
([[source-of-truth]]) — so score and drift live in the popup now, not only on the tile. Below it the governed
files, then the body as a living current-state document (the two
labelled parts — raw source / expanded spec — when authored that way, else the flat body). Neither part is
an agent-authored *current state* — what's-done is read from the derived status, never narrated, because
agents hallucinate completion. The proof and
evolution of that intent live in the **history** tab.
An **issues** tab lists the unified issue work bound to this node — local and forge, open and closed alike,
with both counts on the tab face (the board shows only the lean counts; see [[dashboard-issues]]). Opening
the tab requests page 1 from [[paged-review]] with the fixed `node:` qualifier; no issue row rides the board.
Each entry is the shared compact `IssueCard`, clamped inside the popup and routed to the internal Issues
page selection (`#/issues/<issue-id>`), not directly to the forge. A long pane earns an **extremely compact
embedded face of the canonical Issues filter**: the same query parsing, conjunctive facet semantics, and
real issue fields as [[issues-view]], projected through shared configuration/data adapters rather than a
popup-only filter implementation ([[review-filters]]). Short lists skip the affordance entirely. Its state belongs to the pane,
survives tab switches while the popup stays open, and never mints a competing page address; following a
result still lands on the canonical Issues detail route. The eval timeline mounts the corresponding
domain configuration through that same mechanism ([[eval-tab]]). An **edit** tab makes a
node's in-flight change reviewable from the board: it exists **only** while the node has a pending overlay,
and when it does it **leads** (first tab, editing-session count on its face), so a node mid-change — a
freshly-added ghost most of all, otherwise near-empty on spec/history — opens with its change front-and-
centre. It lazily fetches the unified diff of the node's spec.md in the editing worktree vs the fork point
(`/api/edit`), rendered with the history tab's diff view and **memoised** the same way — re-opening shows the
last diff at once, not a reload — but **revalidated** each open, since a pending change is live.

`panesFor(node)` is the single source of which tabs exist and their order — both the tab bar and App's
keyboard pane-nav read it, so number/Tab keys never cycle to a tab that isn't there. The tab CAPTIONS are
plain labels — no visible key-digit markers (the digit keys still switch panes; that vocabulary belongs to
[[keyboard-nav]] and the help legend, not stamped on every caption) — and the two review tabs tally their
state through ONE chip primitive: the shared [[review-chrome]] `ReviewState` icon + count, issues as
open/closed, eval as fresh pass/fail read from the same `scenarioStates` join every score surface uses
([[eval-score-badge]]); a zero count simply doesn't render, on either tab. The compact filter row those
panes share leads with the ONE result summary — *showing X of Y* from [[paged-review]]'s current-page item
count and full filtered `total`, never by treating the current 25 rows as the whole model — full words on desktop, a bare X/Y
under the phone breakpoint with the sentence kept in the aria-label; no second control, no facet echo, no
repeat of what the caption already tallies. When `Y > X`, a true **View all** anchor opens the canonical
Issues/Evals list with the same fixed `node:` and current compact query, so every result remains reachable.
`panesFor` also
registers an **eval** pane (a fourth reference face), but that pane's paged timeline data contract belongs
to [[eval-tab]], just as the issues tab's content is
[[dashboard-issues]]'; this node owns the popup shell and the spec/history/issues/edit panes, so the eval pane's
reframe into a verdict-over-evidence timeline is that node's evolution, never work-pane drift. The **history** tab is
the one merged version log: the latest version sits expanded with its proof, older ones start collapsed and
reveal one at a time on the **down gesture** once you've finished the open one — scrolling past its end, *or*
a `j`/`↓` keypress when there is nothing left to scroll (a short history with no scrollbar, or the bottom of
a long one). Tying reveal to the gesture, not to scroll movement alone, is what keeps a sub-page history from
dead-ending with older versions forever hidden (a header click also toggles by hand). Disclosure stays
strictly per-entry: there is no expand-all control or bulk-expand replacement, so the down gesture and
row-header toggle remain the complete interaction. The version log itself
fetches **when the history tab first shows** (lazy, like eval/edit — most popup opens never visit it) and
persists after, so returning to the tab stays instant. A version's proof is
the **spec.md line diff** it introduced, fetched lazily on expand — every version, memoised by hash (the
latest no longer shipped precomputed); a version with no recorded change says so plainly. That scaffold — scroll container,
latest-expanded reveal, click-toggle, and the per-row header-over-evidence shape — is **data-agnostic and
shared**: the eval pane ([[eval-tab]]) rides the same component (version rows + diff here, result rows
+ screenshot there). Its embedded filter projects the same result-kind discriminator as [[evals-feed]],
never a popup-only legacy alias. The compact Evals filter projects verdict as its Fail/Pass section and
human review as the distinct Needs review / Reviewed facet, so moving the canonical page's primary visual
axis does not fork field semantics inside the popup.

The "change it in place" surface — the live terminal — relocated to the *session* that does the changing
(`Enter`; see [[session-console]] and [[term-input]]), keyed to a session rather than pinned to a node. The
panel sizes to **itself**, never to xterm's measured width (each pane scrolls its own content, no stray
horizontal scrollbar) — but that sizing lives in `styles.css`, the dashboard's shared stylesheet governed by
[[node-graph]]; this node owns only the
popup component, so a style change elsewhere is never drift here. So the original "one act split in two"
intent stands, but the union is dissolved: intent in the popup, the changing surface with the session.
