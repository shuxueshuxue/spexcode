scenarios:
  - name: renders-merged-issues
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: spec-dashboard/src/IssuesPage.jsx
    description: >-
      Run the dashboard against a backend whose issues span both stores (a local thread with a signer +
      reply, forge issues). Open #/issues and read the rendered DOM: the issue group's rows, then select
      the local thread and read the detail pane; check for raw markdown syntax in the detail.
    expected: >-
      The issue group renders the non-concluded rows in the API's order (no re-sort/rank): one compact
      line each — store chip, concern, status badge, reply count. Concluded issues (closed/rejected/
      landed) are hidden behind a count chip that reveals them. Selecting the local thread opens it in
      the RIGHT detail pane: full header (status, author, "+N signed", clickable node chips), the body
      and replies MARKDOWN-RENDERED (headings/tables/lists — no raw `##` or `|` pipes visible), and a
      reply composer. A forge selection renders the SAME way — its GitHub comments as the reply thread,
      its permalink in the header, and the SAME composer (no read-only note exists) — store never changes
      the thread's shape. No page errors.
  - name: composer-mention-autocomplete
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: [spec-dashboard/src/IssuesPage.jsx, spec-dashboard/src/mentions.jsx]
    description: >-
      On the running issues page, select a LOCAL issue and type into its reply composer, then open the
      New form and type into its body textarea. In each: type `@`, read the dropdown, pick a row with
      ↓/Enter and read the inserted text; clear, type `[[` (and a partial id), pick, read the insertion;
      press Esc with a menu open and read the hash; type plain prose and look for any menu. Then visit
      the session console and re-check its `@`/`[[` menus still open (the shared-module regression).
    expected: >-
      Both composers carry the console's OWN mention dropdowns ([[mentions]] — one shared menu, not a
      fork): `@` lists the live sessions plus `@new` and a pick inserts `@<id> ` (trailing space); `[[`
      lists the spec nodes (a partial query filters) and a pick inserts `[[<id>]] `. The reply
      composer's menu opens UPWARD (visible above the docked textarea), the New form's downward. Esc
      closes the menu, keeps the draft, and stays on #/issues. Plain text never opens a menu. The
      console's `@`/`[[` menus are unchanged. No page errors.
  - name: panel-skeleton
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: spec-dashboard/src/IssuesPage.jsx
    description: >-
      On the running issues page (#/issues), read the master-detail shell: the grid split and the LIST
      COLUMN'S MEASURED WIDTH, the left box (NO tab switcher — the Issues page is its own top-level route
      now), which container scrolls, the sticky filter bar. Click the fold toggle and re-measure the
      columns; unfold. Drive j/k in the issue list; select a row and read the detail pane; finally type
      'j' inside the New-form input.
    expected: >-
      The page is a two-column grid whose LEFT column is SLIM (compact one-line rows, at most ~280px —
      the detail is the protagonist): ONE box — the merged issue list under its own
      sticky filter bar (the store filter + New + the concluded chip, with the open/total meta at its
      END), NO Evals|Threads tab switcher present; its list gets the full column height, scrolling
      itself; the RIGHT detail pane scrolls independently, the page itself never scrolls. The fold
      toggle collapses the list to a thin strip (the detail takes essentially the full width) and the
      strip unfolds it with filters and selection intact. The list
      renders INSTANTLY from app-resident issues (no per-mount fetch). j/k move ONE visible selection in
      the issue list and the detail pane follows immediately — selection IS detail, nothing expands
      inside the list. Deep j keeps the selected row inside the left column's viewport. A key typed into
      an input/textarea reaches the input and never moves the selection. No page errors.

# measuring issues-view

YATU through the REAL running dashboard, never the code: a backend seeded with local + forge issues, the
worktree dashboard pointed at it, and a headless Chromium that opens #/issues and reads the live DOM
(`.fv-master`, `.fv-row`, `.fv-store`, `.fvd`, `.doc-body`) + screenshots it. The loss is the gap between
that reading and the spec: a master-detail Issues page (its own top-level route, no in-page switcher),
one merged store-tagged list in API order, markdown-rendered detail, one thread surface and one composer
over both stores. (This reading style is
what caught the `t(...)` i18n call-convention crash a build could not.)
