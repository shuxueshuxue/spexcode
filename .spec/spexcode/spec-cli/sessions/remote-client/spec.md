# remote-client

## raw source

A session's live state lives where its tmux and worktrees are — on the backend's machine. So the `spex` CLI
must not read or drive sessions in its own process: a manager on one machine should monitor and drive an
agent on another, and there must be exactly **one** actor on a given tmux socket. The CLI's **read and
control** verbs are therefore thin clients of the running backend, the same way the dashboard is — the
backend is the single broker, and which machine you point at is just a URL.

## expanded spec

The read/control commands — `ls`, `watch`, `wait`, `capture`, `send`, `rename`, `rawkey`, `review`, `merge`,
`reopen`, `exit`, `close`, `prompt` — call the backend over HTTP, at the endpoint the routing ladder below
resolves. (`session attach` is the ONE deliberate exception — a foreground terminal can't be brokered over
HTTP, so it stays local and guards that premise loudly against the *resolved* backend; see
[[session-attach]].) They hold **no** in-process tmux/git path, so the backend is the **single actor** on
the tmux socket and the single source of derived state, and pointing `--api` (or `SPEXCODE_API_URL`) at
another machine's backend monitors and drives THAT machine's sessions with no code change — the dashboard's
viewer-points-anywhere model, extended to the CLI. `watch`/`wait` take the board **source** as a required
argument (the backend client), so a poll can never silently read a local board by default.

**Which backend — the ladder, flag-first.** One host runs many projects' backends, and a shell inherits the
launching backend's `SPEXCODE_API_URL` — an env var cannot prove intent (exported-on-this-command and
inherited look identical), which is exactly the misroute: every bare `spex` in a second project's tree
silently drives the first project's backend. So the endpoint resolves once per process, keeping its source:
(1) an explicit **`--api <url>`** (`--port <n>` as localhost sugar) — the only provably deliberate signal —
always wins; (2a) a **worker** (backend-injected `SPEXCODE_SESSION_ID`) trusts its env `SPEXCODE_API_URL`,
the deterministic lifeline its state writes ride, never stolen by discovery; (2b) a **human** shell prefers
the cwd project's **recorded live backend** (`spex serve` records it at bind time; the reader health-probes
first, so a dead record is ignored, never followed); (3) each side falls back to the other; (4) the local
default. A malformed `--api`/`--port` fails loud as usage, never a silent default.

**Writes are project-bound; reads point anywhere.** A URL carries no project identity, so a misresolved
endpoint turns a state write into a wrong-repo mutation. Every MUTATING verb — `new`, `merge`, `send`,
`close`, `rename`, `rawkey`, `reopen`, `exit` — therefore compares the caller's repo root to the backend's
served root before writing and REFUSES loudly on a provable same-host mismatch, naming both identities and
the explicit-routing remedy. An explicit `--api`/`--port` skips the guard (the flag IS the proof of intent);
no local repo, an unreachable backend, or a genuinely remote root fall through to allow. Reads stay unguarded.

**Every command speaks the same selector grammar.** A caller names a session by full id, id-prefix, node,
branch, or `.` for the session owning the caller's current worktree (with the launched own-session id as the
other exact anchor) — and not just the list verbs: the **control** verbs
accept it too. The backend matches `/…/:id`
EXACTLY, so `resolveClientSession` resolves a selector against the live board (the [[session-selectors]]
matcher over `clientListSessions`) and the verb then calls with the resolved FULL id. A non-match is loud and
precise — `none` → no such session, `ambiguous` → the candidate ids — never a silent miss against the backend.

The split is load-bearing and is the whole point. State **producers** stay **local**: `done`/`ask`/`park`/
`idle` and the lifecycle hooks write the agent's OWN per-session record in the GLOBAL store directly (keyed
by session_id — see [[state]]), so an agent must be able to declare its own state even with no backend up. The
backend learns that state by ENUMERATING the store, not by a write of its own. **Launch**
(`spex session new`) keeps its own already-justified path (it needs the backend's auth env — see [[launch]]). Only
the verbs that observe or drive live tmux route here.

**One availability rule, FAIL LOUD.** Unlike a best-effort telemetry POST, an unreachable backend throws a
clear `no backend reachable at <url>` and a non-zero exit — never a silent fall back to a local in-process
path, because that fallback is exactly what would re-create two actors on one tmux socket. `watch` warns once
and keeps streaming (a backend blip must not read as "all sessions fine"); `wait` fails loud rather than
reporting a false timeout.

**Failure stays distinct from emptiness.** A monitoring read must let a manager tell "I couldn't read" from
"the screen is blank": `show --capture` returns a genuinely empty pane as success, but maps unknown-session,
offline (no live pane), and a capture error to distinct non-zero outcomes — a blank screen that exits 0 is
never confused with a read that failed.

**Parity with the dashboard's session gestures.** Anything a human can do to a session by pointing at the
board, an agent manager must be able to do by typing — the backend endpoint already exists in each case, so
the CLI's job is only the thin verb over it. `rename` is the right-click rename ([[session-rename]]) as a
verb: it sets the display-name override (an explicit `""` clears it back to the derived label; a *missing*
argument is a usage error, never a silent clear), and an unknown session exits non-zero off the endpoint's
404. `send --keys` is the last-resort raw `tmux send-keys` channel (never the prompt socket), which
is how a manager un-wedges a worker stuck in an interactive TUI dialog the prompt channel cannot drive (a
select menu wanting one Enter or arrow), and the **last resort** every surface teaching it marks it as: try a
plain `send` text first. It takes whitespace-separated key tokens in the frontend's own
vocabulary (named keys, single printable chars, `C-`/`M-`/`S-` combos), delivered as ONE ordered batch so
strike order survives ([[nav-mode-key-ordering]]); nothing-delivered (unknown session, no live pane, or no
valid token) exits non-zero — a dead keystroke never reads as a pressed one.
