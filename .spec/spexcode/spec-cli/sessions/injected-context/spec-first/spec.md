# spec-first

## raw source

The standing contract already tells an agent to read its spec before implementing ([[core]]), but a
standing instruction is easy to scroll past. Catch it at the moment it matters: the agent's FIRST reach for
the code. That moment is **reading**, not just writing — a pure analysis or "explain this" session reasons
straight from the source and never opens the contract at all, which a mutate-only trigger lets sail past.
So fire at the first code ACCESS, read or edit. Firing exactly once lands when it counts; firing on every
access would just be noise the agent learns to ignore.

## expanded spec

A PreToolUse hook (`spec-first.sh`), wired alongside `mark-active` via `settingsJson`. It acts on the
code-ACCESS tools (`Read` / `Edit` / `Write` / `NotebookEdit`); everything else passes untouched.

Spec-awareness is UNIVERSAL, so — unlike the board-lifecycle hooks — this is NOT gated on `governed`: it
serves any agent, dashboard-launched or user-self-launched. It resolves the session's GLOBAL store dir from
the payload's `session_id` (same scheme as [[state]]) and keeps its sentinel there.

**Bless, ignore, or nudge — once per session.** A sentinel (`spec-checked`, a sibling file in the session's
global store dir — [[runtime]], created on demand even for a self-launched session with no record) makes it
fire at most once:

- First access touches a **spec file** (`.spec/…` or a `spec.md`) → the agent is *already* grounding → set
  the sentinel and allow, **silently**. Reading the spec can never be the thing it blocks.
- First access carries **no resolvable path** → allow **without** consuming the one-shot — neither code nor grounding.
- First access touches a **code file** → set the sentinel and **block once** with the reminder; the agent
  reads its spec, re-issues the access, and it passes. Every later access passes too.

The reminder carries the reconcile-against framing of [[core]], not "obey the spec": *read your node's spec
— resolved from the session record's `node` when it is bound to one, or `spex search <topic>` when it has none —
AND its neighbors (parent, siblings, children), since a node's intent is only fully legible against the
surrounding tree; then change the spec if the task changes intent, or make code honor it if it implements
existing intent; the one forbidden move is code that silently diverges.*

Its own sentinel keeps it from racing `mark-active`'s state write on the same event. Fail-open: an access made
through `bash cat/sed` slips past — this *reminds*, it does not enforce (the Stop gate is the enforcer). Its
edit-time twin [[spec-of-file]] names the governing spec at each edit.
