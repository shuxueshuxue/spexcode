    description: >-
      Through an isolated real gateway with two differently titled projects, load `/projects` and both
      `/p/<id>/#/graph` URLs. Read `document.title`, the global Projects heading/brand, and each scoped graph
      HUD/rail label after catalog and board settle; deliberately make one backend board report the other
      project's title as a negative control.
    expected: >-
      The global tab is exactly the gateway title (`Projects` by default) and each scoped tab is exactly its
      project's resolved title — no `· SpexCode` suffix anywhere. Each scoped HUD, rail mark label, and
      switcher row use the matching URL/catalog identity. A wrong or last-loaded board cannot rename a
      scoped catalog route; a catalog-denied direct-project guest uses only its authorized board identity
      and sees no fleet.

# tab-title loss

Measure the actual browser title and rendered identity surfaces through `/projects` and `/p/<id>/`, not a
helper or an unscoped dev shortcut.
