# issues-view

## raw source

Issues are one object over every store ([[issues]]), and a human wants **one place** to read them — an
agent's local taste issue and a GitHub issue on the same node belong on the same page, not on two
surfaces the user must correlate. So the dashboard carries ONE **issues page** for them, a top-level page
of its own — a peer of the graph, the session board, and the Evals page ([[evals-view]]), never a tab
folded inside another surface (the earlier `Evals | Threads` switcher was collapsed by the human's
directive: evals and issues are two top-level pages, not one page with an in-page switch). The dashboard
stays a **thin window** over the CLI's truth, never a second source — it renders what `/api/issues`
returns and computes nothing, and every write goes through the SAME open/reply the CLI uses, committed
straight to the trunk.

## expanded spec

- **A top-level page of its own.** The page lives at `#/issues` with its own [[side-nav]] rail entry —
  bookmarkable, reloadable, a peer of the graph and the session board. The keyboard door is [[side-nav]]'s
  global ⌥ vocabulary — **⌥4** reaches it from any page, the console included. There is no board-side bare
  key and no console pill: the rail, ⌥4, or history is how you arrive; the leading loss surface's bare
  `f` / ⌥F go to the Evals page instead ([[evals-view]]). Esc never leaves the page ([[side-nav]]) — it
  stays with the page's own stack; going elsewhere is the rail, ⌥digit, or history.
- **The page is a MASTER-DETAIL — a full page deserves a full-height detail, never an expansion inside a
  box.** (The earlier pinned-two-region form was conceived for a height-starved overlay; on a routed full
  page it collapsed content into a small scrolling box — the human called it, and the form changed.) The
  **left column** is ONE box — the merged issue list under its own filter bar (the store filter + New + the
  concluded-count chip, with the **open/total meta at the END of the bar, never at its head**); the bar
  stays sticky over the full-height list, which scrolls itself. The rows are one compact line each, so the
  column stays **SLIM** — a picker, never a reading surface that starves the detail (the human called the
  wide sidebar) — and a **fold toggle** collapses it to a thin strip so the detail owns the width while one
  issue is being worked; the strip is the unfold affordance, and the folded list keeps its state (filters,
  selection, j/k) — the fold is pure geometry. The [[side-nav]] rail names the page, so the
  column carries no title of its own. The **right pane** is the full-height DETAIL of the one selection —
  **selection IS detail** (email-style, no Enter, no in-place expansion): an issue renders its markdown
  body. **j/k walk the issue list** (folded or not) and the detail follows; a key typed into an input is
  never captured.
- **One merged list, store-tagged — RESIDENT, never cold-fetched.** The list is the merged ISSUE list
  ([[issues]]'s `mergedIssues`) — which **excludes eval-remark threads** ([[eval-issue-split]]): a
  scenario-scoped concern is a remark, not an issue (I1), so it never shows in the drain here; it lives on
  the Evals page instead (the [[evals-feed]] row + the [[event-detail]] remark track). The list is app-held
  state beside the board (one data path): the page renders instantly from it on every visit; freshness
  inherits the board's own pattern — the push/change signal triggers a throttled refetch, the 15s cold lane
  backstops (forge-cache updates arrive nowhere else), and `GET /api/issues` answers **304 via ETag** so a
  no-change refetch costs headers only. A write forces the refetch so it shows up where it lands. The view
  renders each issue **in the order the API returns** — [[issues]]'s one time line, stores interleaved
  newest first: the frontend never re-sorts, and **shows no salience/priority ranking** (recurrence is the
  drain's judgment, per [[local-issues]], never an automatic order); signer and reply counts appear as raw
  data, not a rank. **Concluded issues hide by default** — closed / rejected / landed are the archive, not
  the open work, and mixing them in only confuses review; a count chip reveals them on demand (open and
  accepted stay: accepted is approved-but-not-landed, still live). The filter bar carries a **store
  filter** — a small dropdown whose options are DERIVED from the stores actually present in the data plus
  "all" (never a hardcoded list: a new store's driver landing puts it in the menu for free), defaulting to
  "all" so the stores stay mixed; picking one narrows rows AND the counts to that store, and the control
  hides itself when only one store exists. An issue's ROW is one compact line that leads with the issue
  itself, never its plumbing: a **status DOT** (the status vocabulary as color — a boxed "open" on every row
  was noise), then the concern; the trailing edge carries the quiet meta — a compact reply-count pill and a
  **store mini-tag** (borderless, muted, and rendered only while stores are actually mixed — a single-store
  list carries no tags, mirroring the filter's own self-hiding). **The store is metadata, never identity: it
  never leads a row and never sits on a title** (the human called the leading boxed chip). The DETAIL opens
  with the concern ALONE as its title; everything else — status, store, ORIGINATOR + its liveness, signer
  count, node chips, permalink — is the meta strip under it, over the **markdown-rendered body and
  replies** — the same SpecBody renderer the spec
  panes use, so local-issue markdown and spec markdown read as one dialect (raw `##`/table pipes never show),
  and a forge issue's GitHub comments render as the SAME reply thread a local issue thread gets ([[issues]]
  maps them into `replies[]` — one thread type, one renderer). Store never changes the shape; the only
  store-specific affordances are metadata (a local issue's signer count, a forge issue's permalink) — the
  thread itself reads and writes identically.
- **The originator's liveness is on the header — because an un-@'d reply defaults to it.** A committed reply
  gets an implicit originator loop-in ([[mentions]]): a courtesy copy to whoever raised the thread, delivered
  only while they are ONLINE (silent when offline). So the reader must see, honestly, whether a plain reply
  reaches a live agent — the detail header shows the originator (a local thread's `by` is a session id) with
  a liveness dot: **alive** when that session is listed on the board and not offline (its live status paints
  the dot in the board's four-hue `STATUS_COLOR`, [[state]]), **offline** otherwise. It is a thin read-time
  join of the id against the board sessions the page already holds — no new query, no second palette. A forge
  issue's `by` is a github login resolving to no session, so it stays a plain author label (the loop-in is
  silent there by construction). The **signer count renders only when someone actually signed** — a "+0
  signed" is noise, so the badge is suppressed at zero (mirroring the CLI's own nonzero guard); the sign
  feature is unchanged.
- **Node chips focus the graph.** An issue's node chips are clickable — a click routes to the graph page
  and **focuses that node**, so the page stays anchored to the graph it discusses.
- **A human writes from here — to the issue's OWN store, from a composer that is ALWAYS on screen.** EVERY
  issue's detail carries a **reply composer**, and it is **DOCKED at the detail pane's foot** — the thread
  region scrolls behind it, so replying to a long thread never needs a scroll to its bottom (the same
  docked-bar shape as the eval rail's composer and the console's ❯ box, one write-affordance geometry across
  the review surfaces). The composer is the console-❯-box SHAPE: a **single collapsed line while idle** that
  **auto-grows with the draft** (the shared `textarea.js` fitTextarea — one grow routine for the console's
  boxes and the thread composers, capped so it never eats the pane) and reveals its actions row (hint + Send,
  the ⏱ where a clip supplies one) only while **engaged** — focused, carrying a draft or staged frames, or
  showing a send error (an error must never collapse out of view). It is **keyed to the selected issue**, so
  a half-typed draft dies with its selection instead of leaking onto another issue's thread. The POST goes
  to the one store-routed reply verb ([[issues]]'s
  `replyIssue`, author `'human'`) — a local issue's reply git-commits to the trunk store, a forge issue's
  reply posts a REAL GitHub comment through the driver — then reloads so the post shows where it landed
  (the forge case shows the server's read-back, and a failed forge write surfaces in the composer, never
  a silent swallow). The filter bar carries a **New** affordance that opens a fresh LOCAL issue —
  a one-line concern and an optional body, nothing else: a `[[node]]` link written in the text IS the
  node link (the store infers the thread's `nodes:` from them, [[local-issues]]), so the form carries
  **no separate node-ids field** to re-type what the prose already says. New threads open local;
  promotion moves one to the forge. The dashboard adds no store of its own. A `@session`/`@new` in the text
  **dispatches** ([[mentions]]) exactly as a CLI post would, whatever the store — a human summons an
  agent from any thread, and that mention IS the "assign to an agent" verb; the returned one-line
  dispatch summary is echoed briefly. Both composers carry the SAME `@session` / `[[node]]`
  **autocomplete dropdown** the console's inputs use ([[mentions]]'s shared menu — one implementation,
  never a page-local fork): typing `@` lists the live sessions, `[[` lists the nodes (the thread's own
  node leading), a pick inserts the token, and Esc closes the menu without leaving the page. A grammar
  that dispatches workers earns discoverability — a bare hint line proved not enough (the human typed
  `@` and got nothing).
  The reply list and reply composer are ONE shared component (`Thread.jsx`), delivery-agnostic
  (`onSend(text, evidence)`): the issue detail replies to its thread — both stores, the server routing the
  delivery — and the eval detail on the Evals page ([[event-detail]]) renders the SAME thread UI —
  autocomplete included — over its lazily-bound eval remark thread; one thread UI, every home, the store
  just another delivery behind the same seam. A reply is TIME-ANCHORED by a prose convention (same
  philosophy as `Spec:`/`[[node]]`): a body whose first line reads `▶m:ss · <step>` IS anchored to a video
  moment — `Thread` linkifies it (click = seek, when the home supplies the clip) and, over a clip, the
  composer grows a ⏱ affordance that stamps the current frame; a circled frame — or ANY attached blob, a
  video clip included — rides the body as a `![…](/api/yatsu/blob/<hash>)` link whose hash the send derives
  as the thread's typed `evidence[]` (the frame-blob write is [[event-detail]]'s; a clip enters the cache
  via `spex blob put`, [[blob-put]]). Each linked blob renders through the ONE shared evidence renderer
  ([[event-detail]]'s `Evidence.jsx`): the blob's kind is resolved from the Content-Type the blob route
  already serves — the server's byte sniff is the single kind authority, so the thread never grows its own
  magic-number table and a link's label stays free prose — and a video PLAYS as a real `<video>` inline in
  the thread, an image shows (click-to-enlarge), a pruned blob is the honest miss sentinel, identical to
  how the same hash renders on the Evals detail or the node eval tab. The reply stays plain
  `{ by, at, body }` — no schema grows, no typed evidence entries, and a raw reader still
  sees the `▶m:ss` line.
- **Honors the switch.** When the issues workflow is OFF (`enabled: false`, [[local-issues]]'s toggle), the
  view shows a muted "off" state instead of the list — the dashboard reflects the one source of truth,
  never forks it.
