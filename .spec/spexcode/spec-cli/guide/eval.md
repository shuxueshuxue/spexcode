    description: >
      Run the real CLI verb `spex guide config` and read its stdout. It must print the runtime-settings
      manual for spexcode.json / spexcode.local.json — the Config fields plus the crucial committed-vs-
      host-local file distinction, with a concrete launcher-profile example. Also probe an unknown topic
      (`spex guide bogus`) to confirm the fallback still names the real topics.
    expected: >
      Output names BOTH files by role (spexcode.json = committed/portable, spexcode.local.json =
      gitignored/host-specific), documents the launcher schema
      (launchers: { <name>: { harness, cmd } } and defaultLauncher), and shows the working split — the
      portable defaultLauncher name in the committed file, the host absolute `cmd` in the local file.
      Field coverage spans layout, dashboard, sessions, serve, issues, and lint budgets. The sessions
      section explains maxActive's default and that it counts compute slots, not total sessions. The
      unknown topic fails loud, listing `Topics: spec, yatsu, config`.

Measured by YATU: run the actual `spex guide` verb and read its printed output, never by reasoning about
guide.ts. The guide is a reference surface, so the product surface a user touches IS the printed manual —
the measurement drives the real CLI and inspects real stdout.
