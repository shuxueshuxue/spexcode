The session's evaluation, read from the backend (the dashboard Eval tab's CLI twin): every spec node
the session's diff touches, each DECLARED scenario at its CURRENT score (latest reading, rooted at
the session's worktree). Blind spots lead (declared, never measured — the outstanding loss), then
the session's OWN measurements ✦-marked, then the inherited baseline (other sessions' latest
readings) under an explicit divider. A frontend change with no yatsu.md is flagged, never hidden.
--export writes the evaluation as ONE self-contained HTML artifact instead (diff · evidence

Promoted verbs — they answer in this drawer too (same verb, either drawer):
  spex session new|ls|watch|wait|review|merge …   ≡   spex new|ls|watch|wait|review|merge …
And the reverse holds for every sub above: it also answers bare at the top level

you never have to guess which drawer a session verb lives in.

Human escape hatch:
  spex session attach <SEL>            sit in the worker's REAL tmux (detach: C-b d; the session keeps

                                       NEVER run it in a turn (it freezes you): use capture/send/rawkey.
                                       LOCAL-only — the tmux server is the backend machine's, so it fails
                                       loud when the resolved backend is remote. Offline session → loud.

Mentions: @session · [[node]] work in ANY prompt, issue, or remark body — text passed as a CLI arg
included. [[node]] names the topic (a new session derives its node from the prompt's first one);
@session hands the surrounding text to that live agent; @new dispatches a fresh worker.

(state · fail · idle · commit-gate also exist but are hook-driven — the lifecycle hooks call them;
never type them.) ${SEL_NOTE}
