scenarios:
  - name: headline-is-self-summary
    description: >-
      Open the dashboard with at least one live WORKING session (its tmux pane title set) and look at the
      top-left session window. Each row is two lines. Read Row 1: it is the avatar + the session's HEADLINE —
      the worker's OWN live tmux self-summary (its pane title), single-line with an ellipsis — NOT the node
      name, branch, or the few words the human typed at launch. Read Row 2: a smaller, dimmer line carrying
      the colour-coded status word and the op tally (e.g. `working  ~2`). A session that has not come up yet
      (queued / booting, no pane title) shows its launch-prompt placeholder on Row 1 instead, and Row 2 still
      shows its status. Crucially, watch a session through its FIRST seconds of coming up: Row 1 must hold the
      launch-prompt placeholder steadily and then switch ONCE to the agent's glyph-led self-summary — it must
      NOT flicker through tmux's default pane title (the host name, e.g. `ser581555022561`) or a bare `Claude
      Code` splash on the way, because a genuine self-summary always leads with a status glyph and a
      glyph-less title is rejected as "not spoken yet". Screenshot it and file with `spex yatsu eval
      session-activity --image <png> --pass`.
    expected: >-
      A live working session's Row 1 is its tmux self-summary used AS the headline — the agent's own
      description of what it is doing now, having overridden the launch-prompt placeholder it started with;
      Row 2 below carries the status word + op count in a quieter font. A not-yet-live row shows the prompt
      placeholder as its headline and still shows its status on Row 2. A just-booting row keeps that
      placeholder until the agent's glyph-led summary lands — it never flashes the host name or a bare `Claude
      Code` splash in between. The headline is the worker's own pane title (or, when present, a human rename),
      never a bare derived label or tmux default while the agent is up.
    code:
      - spec-cli/src/sessions.ts
      - spec-dashboard/src/SessionWindow.jsx
  - name: console-header-matches-headline
    description: >-
      Through the running dashboard in a real browser, open the session interface (Enter) on a LIVE WORKING
      session whose tmux pane title (self-summary) is set, so its row headline is the agent's own live line —
      visibly NOT the bare node name. Read the **big-title bar** at the top of the session interface (the
      `si-th-name` header above the live terminal) and compare its text to that session's row headline in the
      left list / top-left window. Then pick a session whose headline is long enough to truncate in the
      narrow rows and check how much of it the wide header shows. Screenshot the header bar next to a session
      row and file with `spex yatsu eval session-activity --image <png> --pass`.
    expected: >-
      The header big-title shows the SAME line as the row headline — the worker's live tmux self-summary
      (its pane title), a launch-prompt placeholder only before the agent is up, a human rename always
      winning — never the stable node/branch name the header used to show. The two surfaces read one shared
      content; the only difference is room: a headline that ellipsises early in the compact row shows far
      more of itself in the wide header before truncating. A turn that retitles the row retitles the header
      in lock-step.

# yatsu.md — session-activity

Product surface, measured by **looking** (YATU): the agent screenshots the rendered session window and
confirms each live row uses the worker's pane-title self-summary AS its Row-1 headline (the launch-prompt
placeholder showing only before the agent is up), with the status word + op tally dropped to Row 2 — filing
it as a reading with image evidence and a verdict. The scenario scopes its freshness `code:` to the capture
(`sessions.ts`) and the render (`SessionWindow.jsx`) — not the shared stylesheet — so an unrelated CSS edit
elsewhere doesn't stale this reading.
