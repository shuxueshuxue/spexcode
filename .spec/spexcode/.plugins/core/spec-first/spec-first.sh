# @@@ spec-first - a one-shot governed READ gate. It advances only when the adapter resolves a read path AND
# the spec graph resolves a real `code:` governor for that path. Irrelevant tools, unresolvable reads, and
# uncovered/related-only files leave the sentinel absent, so any number of ungoverned reads cannot mute the
# first later governed read. That read spends the gate and blocks once with its actual governor; retries pass.
# @@@ event vs matcher - materialized shims bind PreToolUse event-wide on every harness. hp_code_path ... read
# is the ONE adapter matcher that reduces Claude/Codex payload differences to a path. This handler owns the
# harness-agnostic state transition and governor lookup; it has no tool-name, harness, or filename branches.
# @@@ all sessions, global sentinel - file governance is independent of a record's `governed` bit, so the
# same gate serves dashboard and self-launched agents. The sentinel lives in the per-session global store dir
# (see hp_store_dir) and is created only by the first governed read. cwd = the worktree.
