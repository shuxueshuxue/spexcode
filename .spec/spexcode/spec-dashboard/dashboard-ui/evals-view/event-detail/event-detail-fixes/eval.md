  - name: draft-leak-selection-reset
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: [spec-dashboard/src/EventDetail.jsx, spec-dashboard/src/Thread.jsx]
    description: >
      In a real browser on a session-scoped eval detail with A/B history, type plain prose and stamp or
      circle an anchored prefill. Deliver an unrelated board SSE/poll repaint, then flip to another A/B
      reading and switch to merged scope without sending. Next create ordinary + anchored prose on scenario
      A, navigate A→B and read B's composer, then return B→A and read A again. Read the composer after every
      transition.
    expected: >
      The same scope/scenario/reading survives an unrelated board repaint with its exact plain prose and
      anchored prefill. Changing A/B reading or scope clears the composer immediately: no anchored line,
      circled-frame markdown, evidence link, or plain typed body appears under the new evidence. Scenario B
      opens empty after A, and returning to A stays empty rather than restoring its discarded draft, so no
      draft can post against the wrong review context.
  - name: eval-originator-chip-session-route
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: [spec-dashboard/src/Dashboard.jsx, spec-dashboard/src/EventDetail.jsx, spec-dashboard/src/SessionInterface.jsx, spec-dashboard/src/Thread.jsx]
    description: >
      In a real browser on #/evals, select an eval whose latest reading was filed by a live session.
      Click its filer/originator liveness chip in the event-detail header and read location.hash plus the
      selected session console tab.
    expected: >
      The live eval filer chip navigates to `#/sessions/<session-id>` and selects that session's console.
      It never opens `#/sessions/new`; offline or missing filers remain non-clickable labels.
  - name: eval-comment-outcome-flash
    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    code: [spec-dashboard/src/EvalsPage.jsx]
    description: >
      In a real browser on #/evals, send an eval remark whose body contains `@new`, wait for the write
      response, and read the page notice above the eval list.
    expected: >
      The Evals page briefly echoes the returned mention outcome, such as `@ new→<session>`, after the
      remark write succeeds, matching the Issues page's reply flash behavior.

# event-detail-fixes loss

Measure through the real dashboard and backend. The proof is the browser's visible composer state, hash
route, selected session tab, and page notice after the same write path a human uses.
