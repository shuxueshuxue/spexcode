// @@@ worktree-sources ([[residence]]) - a fresh session worktree is fed by THREE transports, one per
// source kind, and the kind decides the transport — never a mode branch:
//   - TRACKED project state (`.spec`, `spexcode.json`) arrives by GIT CHECKOUT: the sources are always
//     tracked (git is the database), so `git worktree add` alone delivers them. No symlink — a link is a
//     WRITE-SEMANTICS declaration (write-through to the main tree), and spec writes go back through the
//     branch/merge ritual, not through a side channel.
//   - MATERIALIZED ARTIFACTS (contract blocks, shims, skills) are DERIVED — transported by re-materialize,
//     not by link or copy:
//     sessions.ts materializes into the worktree at creation, and the git-native anchors (pre-commit /
//     post-checkout / post-merge — [[commit-surgery]]) re-materialize on change.
//   - HOST state (`spexcode.local.json`, machine-local and never tracked) is COPIED — a snapshot: the worker
//     reads the same launchers/policy the host had at dispatch, but its writes land on its own copy and die
//     with the worktree, never on the host's real config (a worker once wrote "its" test config through the
//     old symlink and wiped the host's launchers → every later dispatch 401'd).
// This module owns only the third transport (plus hiding what it seeds). A failure degrades that worker
// (default launchers/policy), so it is reported, not swallowed.
