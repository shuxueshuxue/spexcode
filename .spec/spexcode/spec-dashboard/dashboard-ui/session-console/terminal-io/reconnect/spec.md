# reconnect

A live terminal pane must never need a manual page refresh to come back. The [[live-view]] backend fix
removed the cause that used to freeze a pane — a per-session bridge dying under a still-open socket — so
bridge churn no longer closes the socket at all. What remains are the **two** cases the backend cannot mask:
a backend **process** restart (the zero-downtime supervisor reload), which genuinely drops every socket —
and a link that dies **silently**. The second is the treacherous one: an idle terminal socket crossing a
NAT / tunnel / reverse-proxy (the public gateway path) can be torn down in the middle with **no close event
ever reaching the browser** — a half-open connection whose `readyState` still says OPEN. The pane then
looks alive but is deaf: frames stop arriving, a resize sent on it vanishes, and (before this contract)
nothing ever noticed — the frozen-terminal-until-manual-refresh bug, exactly what reconnection exists to
prevent.

So a dead link must be **detectable from traffic alone**, which makes liveness a bidirectional **heartbeat
contract**, same shape as the board stream's ([[dashboard-shell]]): the **server** sends a small keep-alive
ping over every terminal socket on a fixed cadence (10s — traffic that also keeps an idle link warm through
NAT timeouts), and the browser immediately answers pong. Each side holds the other to that promise: the client
force-drops an OPEN socket with no inbound bytes for **2.5× the cadence**, while the server forcibly removes a
viewer that produces no pong inside that same window. Server expiry owns cleanup directly rather than waiting
for a transport `close` event that a half-open link may never deliver, so [[live-view]] cannot retain a ghost
tmux client or size claim. The
cadence is the contract's **one primitive number**, and on the client it lives in ONE place: the shared
heartbeat module (`heartbeat.js`) that the board SSE stream reads too — a single constant for the whole
client, held equal to the server's ping cadences by test, the dead window **derived** from it, never a
free-standing magic number or a per-channel copy. Detection itself is likewise the shared module's
**dead-man's switch** — event-driven, not a polling loop: one one-shot timer re-armed by every inbound
message — so on a healthy link nothing ever wakes, and the switch fires exactly once, at the silence
deadline. No separate
recovery path: detection is the only new act; a presumed-dead drop reopens, backs off, and announces itself
exactly like a genuine drop.

The socket **reopens itself**:
on an unexpected close it retries with **capped, escalating backoff**, indefinitely, while surfacing a
visible **"reconnecting…"** state — the pane tracks a small `connecting | open | reconnecting` health and
shows it in a corner caption, so recovery is **loud**, never a silently dead pane. A connection that
stays healthy a few seconds **resets** the backoff; a flapping server **escalates** to the cap instead of
hammering it. The single **intentional** close — the pane unmounting, when a session goes offline and the
header swaps in the relaunch panel — stops reopening for good.

Recovery is a **stateless reopen**, not a resync or sequence protocol. The endpoint is addressed by a stable
session id and the backend holds all state in tmux, so a reopen is answered exactly like a first connect: a
single coherent full repaint onto a freshly reset screen. There is nothing on the client to replay or
reconcile — which is why reconnection here is a thin **transport** concern, not a correctness mechanism, and
why it does not reintroduce the snapshot-splice scramble [[live-view]] warns against.

The reconnect lives in a small, **framework-agnostic** helper that the terminal wires its open / message /
state callbacks into; its WebSocket implementation and timers are **injectable**, so the reconnect
state machine — backoff schedule, stable-vs-flapping reset, intentional-close suppression, the dead-man
switch's presumed-dead drop, state transitions — is verifiable headlessly, with no browser and no real
network.
