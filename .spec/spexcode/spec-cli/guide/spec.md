# guide

`spex guide` is SpexCode's **reference surface as a command**, not buried docs. It serves the human and
the agent from one verb, picked by an optional topic:

- **no topic → the human SETUP workflow.** The model it teaches is **install once, then let an agent
  drive** — one global install (`npm i -g spexcode`, the [[packaging]] contract) serves *every* project.
  Each adopted repo runs its own `spex serve` from that repo's cwd and publishes its endpoint into the
  current user's host registry; one host-level `spex dashboard` serves the shared gateway/UI, continuously
  discovers backends that are already running or start later, exposes `/projects` for global switching and
  management, and scopes each project's dashboard under `/p/:id/`. There is no per-project UI process or
  API/UI port pairing. Each step names the real seam, not internals: **cwd** picks the repo a backend serves,
  backend **`--port`** avoids listen collisions, and **`spexcode.json`** governs lint's layout. The
  source-checkout path (repo-root `npm link`, `npm run api`, and the Vite/HMR `npm run web`) stays a
  *contributor footnote*, never the installed-user headline: teaching the maintainer's path as the install
  was exactly the drift the packaging node's arrival made stale. The adopt step represents **every
  supported harness, privileging none**: its `spex init --harness` example lists the full built-in
  registry (the prose says to drop what you don't use — any one id or comma-separated subset is
  valid, required with no default). A registry-derived docs assertion (`docs-quickstart.test.ts`)
  holds this page and both READMEs' Quick start to exactly that set, so the example can neither
  regress to one privileged harness nor silently drift from the registry.
- **`spec` / `eval` → the agent-facing FILE-FORMAT manual.** The whole detail of the two authored
  artifacts — spec.md (frontmatter, body, the rules lint enforces) and eval.md (the scenario schema, how
  loss is measured and filed) — so an agent looks the format up on demand instead of reverse-engineering
  it. The eval page is **prescriptive about evidence**: step-unfolding evidence carries a step-map — named
  steps on the evidence's own axis, emitted by the run that produced it, never eyeballed off the artefact.
  A step name is a **short human label** for its moment, never a metadata channel — the run's identity,
  verdict, and extent all have canonical homes (the scenario's `test:` field, the reading's verdict, the
  evidence itself), and the manual says so, because the one free-text field that rides with the evidence
  is exactly where an emitter author is tempted to smuggle provenance (a real adopter baked
  `runner start: <file> :: <case title>` into every step and turned the dashboard's step ruler into noise).
  The concept is tool-neutral (Playwright is one emitter); `--timeline` is axis-tagged (a video's `time`,
  a transcript's `line`, a still sequence's `frame`, a data export's `index` — legacy `tMs` maps read as
  `time`), and a filing's axis must match an attached evidence entry's kind.
  The always-on system prompt is the **clue** that the format exists; this manual carries the detail. An
  unknown topic fails loud (names the real topics), never a silent setup dump.
- **`settings` → the agent-facing RUNTIME-SETTINGS manual.** SpexCode's own settings are self-documenting
  through this same primitive rather than a new mechanism: `spex guide settings` prints every `spexcode.json`
  / `spexcode.local.json` field (launchers, dashboard icon, deterministic lint policy, doctor health budgets,
  layout overrides) with a working
  example — crucially teaching **which of the two files each belongs in**: the committed, portable
  `spexcode.json` vs. the gitignored, host-specific `spexcode.local.json` (absolute launcher paths,
  secrets). Its launcher table mirrors [[launcher-select]]: clean init's per-harness profiles use ordinary
  commands that preserve the harness permission model, while automatic-permission commands are explicit
  authored profiles, never silent defaults. The sessions section names the worker cap's default, precedence,
  and the important meaning of "active": it counts compute slots, not total session rows, so human-waiting
  sessions do not block launches.
  It mirrors the project `Config` type in `layout.ts` (the single source of truth — the manual
  restates the type's own field comments, it does not invent fields, and it omits fields the type keeps
  only as retired compat for the loud notice), and names [[identity-config]]'s one separate host-level
  gateway icon at `SPEXCODE_HOME/config.json`, so an agent can configure SpexCode
  for a user who doesn't know the schema by editing the JSON directly. There is deliberately no imperative
  `spex config set` — the guide + a direct edit is the whole surface.
- **`footprint` → the residence MODEL manual.** The [[residence]] model as an operator's handbook: the
  four artifact kinds and their fixed track facts (materialized artifacts never tracked), the migration
  recipe for a legacy untracked spec tree (`git add .spec spexcode.json` with the pushed-history WARN),
  how the [[content-filter]] behaves on a host-tracked contract file, and the forgetting-law guarantees
  (any-order switching, `spex uninstall` as the empty policy).

Every page describes the PRESENT model only — a retired knob or mechanism is simply absent, never kept
around as a retirement announcement (history is git's job). Whoever still carries a retired config field
is reached by the runtime's loud notice, which names the removal recipe itself; the guide never
duplicates that notice as static text.

`guide` is the SKILL layer of the help journey ([[cli-surface]]): **help answers "what do I type",
guide answers "how do I work".** Command usage — the map (`spex help`) and each command's own page
(`spex help <cmd>` / `spex <cmd> --help`) — lives in `help.ts`; every guide page footers back to those
layers and the help layers name the guide's topics, so neither surface dead-ends. The `--help`
interception's safety contract is unchanged: it prints and EXITS **before** the verb runs — the flag
used to be an ignored no-op that fell through to the verb's side effect, so probing a STREAMING verb
(`spex session watch --help` started a watch that never exits) or a MUTATING one (`spex session new --help`
created a stray session) detonated the very command the user was only asking about. A help probe must
never fire a side effect, and the help it prints must read its own caveats honestly: a verb that blocks
forever (`watch`) says so and points at the one-shot alternative.

The narration is static help text (the spirit of `printHelp` and `spex init`'s next-steps), now living in
its own `guide.ts` module rather than the shared `cli.ts` hub — *not* a planted `.spec` template the way
[[spex-init]]'s contracts are, and *not* routed through the dashboard's i18n catalogs ([[settings]]),
which translate the browser UI, not operator-facing CLI output. `guide` tells you the loop and the
formats; [[spex-init]] performs the first step of it.

This node's stake in `cli.ts` is now a thin dispatch (`process.argv[3]` → `guideText`); the content lives
in `guide.ts`. `cli.ts` is the shared command hub every verb routes through, so a sibling verb's churn
there is that feature's, not `guide`'s drift.
