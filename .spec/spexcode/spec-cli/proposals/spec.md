# proposals

## raw source

An agent finishing a task notices things that feel off — a smell, an awkward boundary, a wish — often
unrelated to its mainline. That judgment is **taste**, and it must not evaporate when the session ends. So a
finished session records such concerns into one shared, durable **forum**; other sessions sign and discuss
them like an async chatroom; a supervisor later drains the forum into real work. This keeps **global** taste
flowing into the codebase's shape, instead of every agent owning only its own slice.

## expanded spec

The forum is **git-tracked data, not a spec node.** A proposal reuses almost nothing of the spec-node
contract — no title/hue/desc/code frontmatter, no parent-ancestor nesting, no lint, no drift, no
version-from-`spec.md`-log, no graph render — so forcing it into a `spec.md` would only earn it a pair of
graph-exemptions to blind it again. Instead each proposal is a **plain markdown file** at
`<root>/.spec/.proposal/<id>.md`. Because that file is **not named `spec.md`**, the spec walk descends past
it without making a node and `isSpecMd` ignores it: the forum is invisible to lint / drift / deriveStatus /
overlay **structurally**, with no special-case exemption. It lives **inside `.spec`** (not a second
top-level folder) so adopting SpexCode still adds one directory — matching how the reflexive `.config`
system already nests there.

- **One file per thread.** The file is a one-line `concern` plus a prose body plus appended signed replies;
  its frontmatter carries `by` (author session), `status`, optional `nodes:` (the product nodes it concerns,
  linked `[[…]]`), and `signers`. One-file-per-thread keeps concurrent worktrees conflict-free: a new
  proposal is a new file (never conflicts); a reply touches one file.
- **Own lifecycle status**, forum-authored never git-derived: `open` → `accepted | rejected | landed`.
- **The forum lives on the trunk, not per-branch.** A write reads and commits **straight to the main
  checkout's `.spec/.proposal/`** — [[main-guard]] admits a commit touching only forum files, because the
  forum is data, not contract, and needs no review ritual. So there is no per-branch copy and no
  cross-worktree union to reconcile: every thread is always present to read, sign, and reply to. This is
  also what lets a **post-merge** proposal land durably — the author's own branch has already merged, so a
  proposal written then could never ride it; committed to the trunk directly, it simply persists.
- **Nudged AFTER the work lands, not during it.** The agent's own task is what matters most, so the forum is
  never raised while it is still finishing — it is raised the moment the work **merges**. A **`post-merge`
  git hook** (harness-side gates live in [[state]]; this one is git-side) fires in the doer's dispatched
  merge turn — merge is dispatched to the session's own agent (see [[dispatch]]) — guarded to the
  `merge node/<id>:` commit so an ordinary pull never nags; its nudge lands in the agent's own command
  output: read the forum, sign/reply if the concern is already raised, else open a new one. Git-native, so
  it reaches a self-launched agent too and costs no harness block-cap.
- **Surface:** `spex propose "<concern>" [--node <id>…] [--body -|<text>]`; `propose reply|sign|resolve <id>`;
  `spex proposals [--node] [--all] [--json]` is the drain view.
- **Dedup is the drain's job, not the write's.** Duplicate proposals are a **signal** (recurrence), folded
  into one thread by a supervisor's judgment ([[supervisor]]) — never a write-time similarity match. And
  recurrence is weighed as **salience, not importance**: a sharp singleton outranks a popular gripe, so the
  count never becomes the priority ranking.

Out of scope (a sibling node, later): a dashboard forum view — read-only over this same union read.
