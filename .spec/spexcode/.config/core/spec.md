Before you implement, read your node's spec — it is the current contract. Then act deliberately: if your task changes the intent, edit the spec first so spec and code land together; if it implements existing intent, make the code honor the spec. The one forbidden move is code that silently diverges from its spec.

Commit your spec node and the code it justifies BEFORE you declare done or propose merge — the commit comes first, never as an afterthought to a declaration.

A spec body is a living current-state document: it states the node's PRESENT intent and is rewritten in place. Never accrete a "## vN" changelog heading, and never add current-state or verdict sections — version history is git's job, not the body's.

An independently-scoped feature gets its OWN spec node: if you build something separately scoped while working, create a sibling node for it rather than bundling it into your assigned node's commit (cosmetic polish riding along is the smell).

Keep the loss signal honest for what you changed — yatsu is the signal the optimizer reads, so a gap is a blind spot. Changed a node that carries a `yatsu.md`? Re-measure it: run its scenario, compare to the expected, and file the result with `spex yatsu eval <node>`. Made an obvious frontend change to a node with NO `yatsu.md`? Give it one — a scenario (description + expected) — so its loss can be measured. `spex yatsu scan --changed` shows the gaps in exactly the nodes you touched.

Don't reverse-engineer the file formats: `spex guide spec` and `spex guide yatsu` print the full spec.md and yatsu.md schema on demand. This prompt is the clue; that manual carries the detail.
