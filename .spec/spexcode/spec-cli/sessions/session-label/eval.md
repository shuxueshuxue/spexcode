      In a real browser on the session board, open a live session's inbox and type `@` to raise the
      mention dropdown. Compare each dropdown row's text against the session LIST rows beside it — the
      same sessions must read as the same headline (the live self-summary / derived label), never as the
      bare launch-prompt truncation or a raw URL. Then right-click a session that has a user rename and
      open Rename: the input must prefill with the raw override itself (editable), while every display
      surface shows the derived name.
    expected: >
      Every dropdown row's label equals the derived headline the session list shows for that session
      (name > activity > promptPreview > …), with zero rows showing a bare title; the rename dialog
      prefills the raw override (the one sanctioned raw consumer). Zero loss = one derivation, every
      surface, and the raw parts reachable only where editing them is the point.

      Take ONE node-less session (name set from its prompt, empty node, an auto branch like
      `node/spec-cli-3ec0`) and name it through two different CLI surfaces: `spex ls` and
      `spex review <id>`. Both are "who is this session" displays and must agree.
    expected: >
      `spex ls` and `spex review` show the SAME identity for the session — the derived label (its name),
      never one showing the name while the other falls back to the raw branch. Zero loss = the review
      surface reads a `deriveLabel`-produced field, not its own re-inlined `node||branch||id` chain.

# session-label — measurement

YATU: the loss is a session reading as two different names on one screen. Measure by looking at the two
surfaces together in a real browser — the mention dropdown against the session list — plus the rename
dialog's prefill; the wire-shape half (bare fields absent, precedence) is pinned by the unit test and
needs no browser.
