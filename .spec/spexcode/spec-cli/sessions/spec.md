# sessions

## raw source

A SpexCode **session** is a unit of work the dashboard and the CLI launch, drive, and retire through
**one shared module** (the dashboard is a thin caller; `spex` is the CLI). The **worktree** is the
durable thing, not the tmux process — a session survives a kill, a reboot, or a moved folder. The
**agent writes its own state** and may only *propose* merge or close; a **human** makes those calls.
Nothing auto-disappears, so a self-finished session stays findable, and the dashboard and the terminal
are two faces of the **same** state.

## expanded spec

The durable unit is the worktree: each carries an untracked `.session` file (`node` / `session`-id /
`status` / `proposal` / `note` / `merges`) plus a `.session-prompt` sidecar holding the originating
launch prompt. There is no in-memory map — the list is read from the worktrees every time, so state
survives a backend restart. `sessions.ts` holds the machine and is the only writer of `.session`.

The list is ordered by **session birth, oldest first** — derived from the `.session` file's birthtime,
which is fixed for the worktree's life (the file is rewritten in place on every state change, so mtime
drifts but birthtime does not). Git enumerates worktrees alphabetically by path, and a path is a slug of
the launch prompt, so the raw order is effectively arbitrary *and* reshuffles whenever a session joins or
leaves; birth order instead gives every session a permanent slot with new ones appending at the end — one
stable spatial map shared by the dashboard window, the session tabs, and `spex ls`.

The subsystem divides into governed concerns, each its own child node:

- **[[launch]]** — bringing a worker up: the `reclaude` wrapper, the per-session rendezvous socket, the
  non-truncating system-prompt + launch-prompt delivery, `CLAUDE.md` isolation, and the concurrency
  cap with its durable launch queue.
- **[[state]]** — the lifecycle state machine: the declared statuses, the per-session `Stop` /
  `PreToolUse` / `Notification` hooks that gate them, AskUserQuestion → `needs-input`, and socket-based
  liveness via `reconcile`.
- **[[dispatch]]** — delivering a prompt to a live agent over its rendezvous socket (socket-only,
  fail-loud), and the merge intent that rides that path.
- **[[graph]]** — the live monitor network (edge A→B iff A runs `spex watch B`) and the `spex watch`
  lifecycle event stream.
- **[[live-view]]** — the dashboard's live terminal: one real tmux client per session, viewer
  subscriptions that outlive the client so a pane never freezes, and the warm-bridge prewarm.
- **[[remote-client]]** — the `spex` CLI as a thin backend client: its read/control verbs route through the
  backend (so the backend is the single tmux actor, and `SPEXCODE_API_URL` points at any machine's sessions),
  while state producers stay local.

### Surfaces

One surface stays with the overview. `buildBoard` (`board.ts`) assembles the dashboard's runtime state —
merged tree + per-worktree overlay + the session list — in one module, served identically at HTTP
`/api/board` and `spex board` (the frontend only adds x/y pixels). The session's live pane is read as text by
`captureSessionResult` behind `GET …/capture` — failure (unknown / offline / capture-error) kept distinct
from an empty pane — which `spex capture` reads as a backend client (see [[remote-client]]).
