// @@@ supervisor - zero-downtime backend reloads. SO_REUSEPORT (two processes binding 8787 so the new
// one is live before the old drains) is unsupported on this platform (macOS/Node → ENOTSUP), so instead
// the supervisor OWNS the public port (8787) as a tiny raw-TCP proxy and runs the real Hono server as a
// CHILD on a private internal port. On a code change we boot a NEW child, wait for its GET /health to
// answer 200, atomically flip the proxy's upstream to it, then retire the old child after a short drain.
// The public socket never closes, so port 8787 has no gap — a reload (e.g. a node merge touching
// spec-cli/src or an imported sibling package) is invisible to API callers. Raw byte-piping also carries the WebSocket upgrades
// (terminal socket / pty bridges) for new connections transparently; in-flight WS on the old child drop
// at drain time and the client reconnects, exactly as the no-supervisor reload already did.
