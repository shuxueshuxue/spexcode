desc: The instance home — SpexCode's DIY dev-flow plugins live here as skill-shaped config nodes.

`.config/` is the **instance** of the config system: the concrete dev-flow plugins SpexCode ships for
working in this repo. Each plugin is a skill-shaped node — its folder *is* the unit (a `spec.md` plus any
co-located scripts) — living as a flat child of `.config/` and carrying a `surface: command|system` field
that names where it plugs in, per [[config]]'s [[surface]] field-driven routing.

`/api/config` and the launcher's system gather read from here, not from [[config]] (which holds the
*spec of the config system* itself). Only **built/active** plugins gather — a `pending` node is declared
intent, not yet an active plugin, so it renders on the board but is neither offered as a command preset nor
materialized into the agent's contract.

Which of these plugins `spex init` ships to an adopter vs. keeps **spexcode-only** is the [[init-preset]]
rule. Only two are spexcode-only here — `taste` (this repo's *own* engineering principles) and `voice-before-ask`
(needs this repo's local voice MCP); every other active plugin ships.
