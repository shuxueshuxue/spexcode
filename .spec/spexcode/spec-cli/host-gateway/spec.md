# host-gateway

The bar: **a user who runs several SpexCode projects on one machine opens ONE dashboard and reaches all
of them — no `--api-port` pairing, no per-project UI process, no "current project" toggle.** Each
backend stays exactly what it is — one `spex serve` per repo, loopback-only, auth-unaware, ignorant of
every other project; the HOST level is where multiplicity lives.

**The seam between the two levels is the endpoint record.** After its public bind succeeds, a serve
ATOMICALLY (tmp + rename — a reader never sees a torn record) publishes `{url, pid, instanceId, root,
startedAt}` into the per-user global project store and, on a clean stop, removes only a record that
still carries its own `instanceId` — never a newer serve's, never another project's. The `instanceId` is
minted once per serve lifetime and handed to every child through env, so the identity is stable across
zero-downtime reloads; the child answers it (with the root it serves) at `GET /api/instance`. A record
is therefore *checkable*, not just present: the reader compares the record's `instanceId` + `root`
against the live answer at its `url`, and only a full match counts as online. A crashed serve, a
recycled port now serving something else, or a record copied into the wrong store slot (the slot must
equal `encodeProject(root)`) all fail the match and degrade to "offline project" — never a proxy to the
wrong backend.

**`spex dashboard` is [[gateway-hub]] plus the host registry — one gateway, one seam, nothing duplicated.**
The hub owns routing, `/p/:projectId/*` proxying (HTTP/SSE/WS, prefix-stripped, gateway cookies
stripped), and every authorization decision ([[gateway-auth]]: admin scope implicit from
loopback until an admin password exists; per-project gates as configured). This node mounts the host level
onto the hub's extension seam: `GET /projects` rows become the **reconciled** list — every cataloged or
record-claimed project with its instance-validated `online` state, not just the live records — each
carrying the hub's gating flag; `GET /projects/stream`
is that list as a live SSE; and paths the hub doesn't own serve the built dashboard dist once for the
whole host. Per-request routing truth stays the hub's: a record is routable only in the identity shape,
only in the store slot its own root encodes to, and only to a loopback url — the shared record-read seam
(`readEndpointRecord`), not a second registry. A project with no record answers 404 before any upstream contact. No
`--api-port`/API_URL pairing survives at this surface; `spex serve ui` remains the explicit pairing.

**The durable known-project catalog remembers what records cannot.** Records die with their serve; the
catalog (`~/.spexcode/projects.json`) is the host's memory, populated by explicit registration
(`POST /projects {root}` — normalized to the repo's main checkout, git-repo required, matching init's own
precondition) and by auto-adoption of any validated live record. Its project operations ride the same
hub admin scope. `GET|PUT /projects/:id/config` is the narrow source-file seam for the project's raw,
committed `spexcode.json`: it works while the backend is offline, treats an absent file as `{}`, accepts
only a top-level JSON object, writes atomically, and rejects a stale revision rather than overwriting a
concurrent edit. It never exposes `spexcode.local.json`, whose machine-specific layer may carry sensitive
paths. Operations remain **spawned `spex` verbs, never forked logic**: `/projects/:id/init` and `/doctor`
run the real `spex init` / `spex doctor` with cwd = the project root (same git/harness/additive
guarantees, exit code + transcript returned), and `/projects/:id/serve` starts an offline project's
backend as a **detached** `spex serve` that publishes its own record and outlives the gateway. A
malformed catalog degrades loud-but-alive on read and refuses writes — nothing clobbers the file.

**Backends never depend on the gateway.** Kill the gateway and every serve keeps serving; direct CLI
discovery ([[remote-client]]'s ladder) reads the same records straight from the store, gateway or no
gateway. The gateway obeys the shared port contract (a busy port is a loud non-zero exit via the one bind
helper) and carries the standard connection reaping — both via the hub. Authentication is deliberately NOT
this node's mechanism: it is [[gateway-auth]]'s, decided once at the hub — this node adds no second gate,
no second cookie, no bypass. Transport is likewise the hub's: `startHostDashboard` accepts the hub's `tls`
option and hands it through unchanged, so an operator deployment runs the ONE host gateway directly over
HTTPS — every surface (admin list, /p proxying, the shell) on that one TLS port, no second proxy in front,
and a plaintext client on the TLS port is refused, never silently downgraded. Absent `tls`, `spex
dashboard` stays plain loopback HTTP; `--host` widens the bind, behind whatever gates the operator
configured.
