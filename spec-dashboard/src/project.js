// The project-scope seam ([[dashboard-shell]] / [[projects-hub]]): under the multi-project gateway the
// SAME built SPA is served at two kinds of address — the hub root `/` and the project-scoped
// `/p/<projectId>/` — and every backend surface of a scoped page sits under that same prefix
// (`/p/<id>/api/graph`, the terminal WebSocket, the SSE stream). The scope is read ONCE from
// location.pathname at boot and every `/api` URL routes through apiUrl(), so no feature module knows
// whether it is running scoped or not — the pathname is the whole contract, which is also what makes a
// scoped page shareable: the address bar IS the project-scoped URL, and the gateway can gate it by path.
// Outside the gateway (vite dev, a single-project `spex serve ui`) the pathname has no /p/ prefix, the
// base is '' and every URL is byte-identical to the pre-multi-project app.

// '/p/<id>' or '/p/<id>/anything' → that id; anything else → null. The id segment is URI-decoded for
// display/API use; the RAW segment is kept for prefix building so the base always matches the address
// the page was actually served under.
