# file-attach

The agent and the dashboard rarely live on the same machine, so an image in your clipboard is bytes the
agent can't see. This node closes that gap: **a file attached to the prompt is carried to the machine the
session runs on, and the prompt is left holding its path.** An attachment becomes an ordinary local path the
agent can just read — no bytes smuggled through the prompt, no out-of-band copy step the human has to narrate.

## attach three ways, both authored surfaces

The same gesture set works on **both** authored composers — the New Session prompt and a running session's
[[command-box]]:

- **Paste** a file (a screenshot, a copied file). A paste that carries files attaches them; a plain text
  paste is untouched and types as before.
- **Drop** a file onto the box. The surface rings to signal it's droppable while a file hovers.
- **Pick** a file from the small attach affordance beside the box.

An offline session has no Command Box and takes none of these — there is no live machine to carry a file to
until it relaunches.

## the path is the whole handoff

Each attached file is uploaded to **the backend**, which is by construction **the machine every session and
worker runs on** — its temp dir is the same `/tmp` home the rendezvous sockets already use, so an upload
shares the worker's filesystem for free. The file lands in one `spexcode-uploads/` sink there under a
collision-proof, path-safe name, and its **absolute path** is what gets spliced into the prompt at the
caret, padded so it never glues to a
neighbouring word. The human types around it; the agent reads it. That is the entire contract — "send the
file over, hand me the path" — with no transport leaking into the prompt text.

## fail loud, never silently drop

An upload is the one moment a file can vanish, so it is **fail-loud on both ends**. The server refuses an
empty file, and a stray oversized one, rather than quietly filling the disk; a write that fails answers with
its reason, never a false success. The client mirrors that: while bytes are in flight the attach control
shows it's busy, and an upload that returns no path raises a visible error on that surface instead of
swallowing the file. A crafted filename can't escape the upload dir — the name is reduced to a bare,
sanitised basename first.

## where it lives

The gestures, the path-splicing, and the attach affordance are the authored composers in `SessionInterface.jsx`
([[session-console]], [[command-box]]); their styling rides `styles.css`. The upload endpoint and the
`/tmp` sink are the backend's ([[api-endpoint]], [[sessions]]) — a thin route over a small upload module,
the same shape [[session-rename]] uses to span the UI and the server for one feature. This node's slices of
those shared files are just the attach-control styling in `styles.css` and the `/api/uploads` route in
`index.ts`; the eval tab's `.eval-*` classes and its eval-blob endpoint, reworked when the eval engine was
reframed to serve a verdict over transcript-or-image evidence, are [[spec-eval]]'s churn, not file-attach's
drift.
