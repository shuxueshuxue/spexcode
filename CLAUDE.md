# SpexCode — notes for agents working in this repo

SpexCode is a spec-driven, self-developing dev tool that **dogfoods itself**: every change to the
tool is recorded as a versioned *spec node* and merged into `main` through a `node/*` branch. Read
this before starting — it's the stuff that isn't obvious from the file tree, and it's what costs an
agent the most time to rediscover.

## The dogfood ritual (how every change lands)

A change isn't "done" until it's a spec node merged into `main`:

1. Branch `node/<id>` off `main`.
2. Make the code change **and** add/update the spec node (`.spec/.../<id>/spec.md`) that states the
   intent. A repeat change to an existing node appends a `## vN — <summary>` section to its `spec.md`.
3. Commit on the node branch: `spec: <id> — <reason>`, with a `Session: <sess-id>` trailer in the
   commit **body** — that trailer is the version's attribution (see "Git is the database" below).
4. Merge into `main` with `--no-ff`: `merge node/<id>: <reason>`.
5. Delete the node branch; retire the worktree.

`main-guard` (a pre-commit hook) **blocks direct commits on `main`**; merges pass because `MERGE_HEAD`
is set, and node-branch commits pass because they aren't on `main`. Escape hatch for seeding/topology
only: `SPEXCODE_ALLOW_MAIN=1 git commit …`. Install/repair the hook with `npm run hooks` — **re-run it
after the hook source (`scripts/hooks/pre-commit`) changes**, since `.git/hooks/pre-commit` is a copy.

Convention for live work: worktrees in `.worktrees/`, branch `node/<id>`, plus an untracked `.session`
file (`node:` / `session:` / `status:` lines) that the layout linker reads.

## What a spec node is

- A node = a directory under `.spec/` containing a `spec.md`. `id` = directory basename; `parent` =
  the nearest ancestor directory that also has a `spec.md`. The tree root is `.spec/spec-dashboard`.
- `spec.md` = frontmatter (`title`, `status` ∈ merged|active|pending, `session`, `hue`, `desc`) + a
  markdown body. Subsequent versions are appended as `## vN — …` sections in the same file.
- **Git is the database.** A node's `version` is the number of commits that touched its `spec.md`
  (`git log --follow -- <path>`); history rows come from the same log, each attributed via the
  `Session:` commit trailer. There is no separate datastore — the dashboard is a read-time aggregator.

## Architecture / data flow

- `spec-cli/` — Hono backend, run with `tsx` (**no build step**; `npx tsc --noEmit` to type-check).
  Reads `.spec` + git live and serves `GET /api/specs`, `GET /api/specs/:id/history`,
  `GET /api/layout`. Loader: `src/specs.ts`; git access: `src/git.ts`; portability seam:
  `src/layout.ts` (`resolveLayout()`, optional `spexcode.json` override for non-default layouts).
- `spec-dashboard/` — Vite + React. `src/data.js` fetches `/api/specs` and **decorates client-side**:
  it computes each node's x/y (a left→right tidy tree) and generates placeholder SVG A/B screenshots
  and mock session logs. Treat `data.js` as a stand-in for the real git/tmux/yatsu feed.
- `spec-yatsu` — named as the third package (computer-use A→B evidence) but **not yet present**.

## Running it

- Backend: `npm run api` → http://localhost:8787
- Frontend: `npm run web` → Vite. **Port 5173 by default but not pinned** — it takes the next free
  port (e.g. 5174) and prints `Local: http://localhost:<port>/`; read that line for the real port.
  Vite proxies `/api` → :8787, so the backend must be running too.
- Toolchain: **npm, not pnpm**; Node is pinned via `.nvmrc` (22).

## Naming

The project is **SpexCode**. npm root package: `spexcode`; CLI package: `@spexcode/spec-cli`. The
package *directory* names (`spec-cli`, `spec-dashboard`, `spec-yatsu`) are component names and stay
lowercase-hyphen — they are not the brand. Env escape hatch: `SPEXCODE_ALLOW_MAIN`. Optional layout
override file: `spexcode.json`.
