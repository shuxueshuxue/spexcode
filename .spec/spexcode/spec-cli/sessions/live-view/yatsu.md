  - name: warm-bridge-pre-sized-no-reflow
    tags: [backend-api]
    description: >-
      Measure the on-attach reflow through the real bridge surface. Seed two live sessions on a tmux
      socket at the cold default (120x40). Start the supervisor and let it pre-warm both, then have ONE
      viewer attach and fit to a browser size (e.g. 214x57) via the real path (attachViewer + resizeBridge,
      the same calls the dashboard WebSocket drives). Poll tmux `#{window_width}x#{window_height}` for the
      OTHER, unwatched session across one supervisor tick. ZERO loss = it converges to the viewer size
      off-screen, so a later attach to it sends a size that already matches and tmux re-wraps nothing.
      File with `spex yatsu eval live-view --scenario warm-bridge-pre-sized-no-reflow --result <txt>`.
    expected: >-
      The unwatched warm bridge's tmux window moves from the cold default to the last-known viewer size
      WITHOUT any viewer ever attaching to it; a viewer opening it afterward finds the pane already at its
      size — the open-time fit is a no-op, so there is no visible cols/rows reflow. A watched session stays
      put across ticks (no thrash), since its pre-size equals its own recorded fit.
  - name: set-size-to-first-frame-is-event-driven
    tags: [backend-api]
    description: >-
      Measure the "visible → full screen" gap: how long from setting a size to the viewer receiving the
      coherent full frame, and whether it converges on the asked size. On a tmux socket, warm a bridge
      through the real API (attachViewer at a first size), then — with the bridge already up (the warm
      case, which is the real path when a hidden pane becomes visible) — call resizeBridge to a new size
      (e.g. 100×30) and time it to the viewer's next frame. Confirm (1) that latency is event-level (a few
      ms, well under the ~320ms the old pty-resize + geometry-poll path cost), (2) tmux's window converged
      to exactly the asked size (the frame is drawn on the settled geometry, no half-frame), and (3) no
      polling is involved — the frame is driven by tmux's %layout-change + capture-pane reply, not a
      geometry read loop. File with `spex yatsu eval live-view --scenario
      set-size-to-first-frame-is-event-driven --result <txt>`.
    expected: >-
      A warm resize produces the full frame in ~5–20ms (event-driven: refresh-client -C sets the size,
      %layout-change confirms convergence, a bounded capture-pane seeds the frame), an order of magnitude
      under the ~320ms polling path it replaces. tmux's window equals the asked size when the frame lands,
      so the screen is coherent at the converged geometry — never a mid-flight half-frame. The frame is one
      clear+home + the real pane rows (with escapes/UTF-8 intact), and live pane output continues to arrive
      as %output events after it.
  - name: attach-seed-carries-pre-attach-history
    tags: [backend-api]
    description: >-
      Measure that the wheel can reach output from BEFORE the client attached (the "wheel scrolls real
      history" contract, in control mode). On a tmux socket, print far more lines than the visible screen
      holds (e.g. 1200 lines into a 24-row pane) so most scroll into tmux history BEFORE any bridge exists.
      Then attach a viewer through the real API (attachViewer with a size) and inspect its first frame: it
      must carry the visible tmux view without seeding a browser-owned history buffer. Send wheel-up frames
      through the same WebSocket/API path the dashboard uses
      and confirm tmux enters copy-mode, `#{scroll_position}` increases, and the viewer receives repainted
      older rows from tmux's current view. Then send wheel-down frames and confirm the copy-mode view moves
      back toward the bottom. Finally detach fully and re-attach (a fresh bridge) and confirm history is still
      reachable through the same tmux-owned wheel path. File with `spex yatsu
      eval live-view --scenario attach-seed-carries-pre-attach-history --result <txt>`.
    expected: >-
      Wheel-up on a NORMAL-screen pane enters tmux copy-mode and increases `#{scroll_position}` while the
      viewer receives a coherent repaint of older tmux history; wheel-down moves that same tmux view back
      toward the bottom. The browser does not expose or scroll an independent xterm history buffer, and no
      mouse bytes are littered into the shell prompt. A full-screen alternate-screen TUI with SGR mouse reports
      still gets forwarded wheel reports, so the app scrolls itself.
  - name: output-preserves-utf8-wide-chars
    tags: [backend-api]
    description: >-
      Measure that wide characters survive the live %output byte path (the regression that shattered the
      display). On a tmux socket, attach a control-mode bridge through the real API, then flood the pane with
      MANY lines of CJK + box-drawing + emoji (e.g. `星★号😀笑脸└─┘中文🀄🎉αβγ` ×thousands) — enough bytes that
      the multi-byte characters straddle node-pty's read boundaries, the exact condition that used to corrupt
      them. Capture the bytes the bridge broadcasts to a viewer, decode as UTF-8, and count U+FFFD + check the
      payload survived. File with `spex yatsu eval live-view --scenario output-preserves-utf8-wide-chars
      --result <txt>`.
    expected: >-
      The broadcast bytes decode to ZERO U+FFFD and every flooded payload copy is intact — because the bridge
      parses the stream as BYTES end-to-end (node-pty gives raw Buffers, lines split on the newline byte,
      %output un-escaped at the byte level and forwarded raw, no string round-trip). A path that decodes
      node-pty chunks to a string first shatters any wide char split across two reads into a U+FFFD; that path
      must be absent.
  - name: hidden-connect-defers-undersized-first-paint
    tags: [backend-api]
    description: >-
      Measure the undersized first frame a hidden (0×0) connect used to receive. On a tmux socket, warm a
      bridge through the real API (attachViewer spawns the shared client, resizeBridge sets a "prewarm"
      size). Then attach a SECOND viewer with NO initial size — the warm-and-hidden dashboard connect — via
      attachViewer, and count the pane bytes it receives. Probe three things: (1) over ~300ms BEFORE any
      resize it must receive ZERO frames — the first paint is driven PURELY by the first resize, with no timer
      fallback that would paint on its own; (2) send the client's first resize (resizeBridge to the real
      visible size, e.g. 214×57) and confirm it now receives the deferred first frame and tmux's window
      converges to that size; (3) a SEPARATE viewer that never resizes receives NOTHING — fail-loud, no timer,
      because a pane no one makes visible is a pane no one looks at and so needs no frame. File with `spex
      yatsu eval live-view --scenario hidden-connect-defers-undersized-first-paint --result <txt>`.
    expected: >-
      The hidden, no-size viewer receives NO pane bytes until its first resize — the server draws no
      undersized prewarm frame into a still-hidden buffer (first-visible, not first-connect), and no timer
      ever paints one either. Its first resize draws the one first frame at the real visible size (the window
      converges to it; the viewer receives bytes). A viewer that never resizes stays blank forever — the
      first-paint path holds zero timers, so a frame arrives only as the pure consequence of a resize event.

# yatsu.md — live-view

The live terminal's product surface is measured through the **real bridge API** the dashboard drives
(`attachViewer` / `resizeBridge` over the per-session WebSocket) plus tmux's own reported window size —
not an internal probe. The losses, about a pane behaving wrong the moment a human opens it:

- **on-attach reflow** — the pane re-wrapping from a stale size to the browser size. Zero loss is the
  supervisor holding every warm bridge at the last-known viewer size, so the pane is already correct
  before they look.
- **undersized first frame** — a warm pane connects while still hidden (0×0), so a guessed-size first
  frame would land short and then snap to full when the human looks. Zero loss is the server **deferring**
  that first paint **purely** to the client's first resize (drawn at the real visible size), with **no timer
  fallback** — a pane that never resizes is one no one makes visible, so it needs no frame, keeping the
  first-paint path event-driven and zero-timer just like the resize convergence.
- **visible → full-screen latency** — the gap from a pane becoming visible (its size set) to its coherent
  full frame. The control-mode boundary makes this **event-driven and timer-free** — `refresh-client -C` sets
  the size, the guaranteed `%layout-change` confirms convergence, a bounded `capture-pane` seeds the frame — so
  zero loss is a few ms on the converged geometry, an order of magnitude under the ~320ms the old poll cost.
- **wide-character integrity** — `%output` passes high bytes through raw, so decoding them as anything but
  UTF-8 truncates every CJK / box-drawing / emoji character to one wrong byte (the regression that shattered
  the display). Zero loss is a wide-character line round-tripping through the real bridge byte-for-byte.
- **history reach** — with control mode streaming only post-attach `%output`, the wheel would reach nothing
  from before the client attached. Zero loss is the pane's real history reachable through tmux itself:
  a normal-screen pane scrolls tmux copy-mode and repaints that view; a full-screen TUI receives forwarded
  wheel mouse reports so the app scrolls itself.
