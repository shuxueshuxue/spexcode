desc: The proactive loop that keeps the loss signal fresh AND covered — the core contract tells every agent to measure what it changed, and the Stop gate, scoped to that agent's own changed nodes, nudges once on a stale score or an uncovered frontend node — '推一把' points at PRODUCING the real measurement yourself on whatever surface the stale scenario declares. Both reuse `spex yatsu scan --changed`.

# yatsu-proactive

## raw source

A loss signal is only useful while it is FRESH and COVERED: a node's reading goes stale the moment its code
moves, and a frontend node with no yatsu.md has no signal at all. Both rot silently when measuring is
on-demand. Make the system keep its own scores honest — tell every agent to measure what it changed, and
surface the gap in the flow. But surface only the agent's OWN gaps: nagging it about a score that went stale
in a node it never opened is noise it rightly ignores (three workers in a row asked "is this mine?").

## expanded spec

Two surfaces, one engine — [[yatsu-core]]'s **`spex yatsu scan --changed`**, scoped to the nodes the
current branch touched (vs its fork-point from the main branch), reporting three gap classes: `yatsu-drift`
/ `yatsu-missing` (a node with a yatsu.md whose score is stale / unmeasured) and `yatsu-uncovered` (a
frontend node carrying no yatsu.md).

The **core contract** ([[core]], folded into every launched agent) carries the rule: changed a node with a
yatsu.md? re-measure it. Made an obvious frontend change to a node with none? give it one. That makes
measuring part of finishing, not a chore left for later.

The **Stop gate** (the stop-gate hook) adds the nudge. When a session stops CLEAN-DONE (its work committed
and a done/awaiting declaration made — the moment a change lands), the gate runs `scan --changed` and, if a
gap touches what the agent changed, emits a pointer through the hook's additionalContext: re-measure a stale
score, or give an uncovered frontend node a scenario. It is **not a gate** — a gap is a heads-up, not a
wall, and it never alters the commit/declare gates' stop verdict, riding their allow paths only.

**'推一把' — surface-neutral.** The re-measure pointer does not merely say "re-measure"; it pushes: PRODUCE
the measurement YOURSELF with a real run of the scenario's *actual surface*, don't desk-check it, and don't
defer to reviewing a recording after the fact (that is the separate e2e-review command). A score rots
because measuring is real work an agent will skip at the finish line unless pushed there — and that is true
of every surface, not only the browser. So the push privileges NONE: it is one line folded into the generic
stale/unmeasured nudge, covering all of [[yatsu-core]]'s `lint.scenarioTags` surfaces
(frontend-e2e / backend-api / cli / desktop / mobile) equally. WHICH surface to run is read from the tag
`scan --changed` carries on each drift/missing finding line — the tag tells the agent whether the "real run"
means driving a browser, hitting a backend API, exercising the CLI, or a device — so the hook itself
hardcodes no surface and spawns no per-surface branch. An uncovered node carries no scenario to run yet, so
it stays the generic "give it one" nudge. Still one emit on the same allow path, never a block: a blocking
measurement gate would wall an honest stop, which is over-guiding, not '推一把'.

It **fires once.** The additionalContext itself forces one continuation, so the gate guards the nudge on
`stop_hook_active` — re-emitting on that forced re-stop is exactly what looped 31 turns and tripped the
Stop-hook block cap. Nudge on the first natural stop; stay silent on the continuation; let the agent stop.

Out of scope: scan's own engine, freshness derivation, and the changed-node / frontend-surface
classification ([[yatsu-core]]); this node is only the two proactive surfaces that consume it.
