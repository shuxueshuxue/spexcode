# keyboard-nav

Move through the spec tree by **relationship, not geometry** — the tree sits at fixed positions and never re-plots; the camera moves.

## keymap

**Board** (graph mode):

| key | action |
|---|---|
| `↑`/`k`, `↓`/`j` | up / down the focus node's column |
| `←`/`h` | to the parent |
| `→`/`l` | to the nearest child (closest in y); on a leaf, to the nearest node in the columns to the right (grid-weighted) |
| `+`/`-`, `0` | zoom in / out, back to overview zoom |
| `i`, double-click | open the node-info popup |
| `/` | open the search palette — jump across nodes, sessions & issues by name |
| `o` / `O` | cycle focus through changed nodes — the locked session's if one is locked, else all in-flight (`O` = reverse) |
| `Esc` | release the locked session, when one is locked (else a no-op on the bare board) |
| `Enter` | cross into the node's live session(s) |
| `@` | start a fresh New Session targeting the focus (opens on the New tab, focus mention prefilled) |
| `t` | toggle spec graph ↔ session graph |
| `?`, `,` | help overlay, settings |
| `nn`, `dd` | chord: new child under focus, delete focus |

**Inside the popup** (keys re-bind to the popup, never the board behind):

| key | action |
|---|---|
| `←`/`→`, `h`/`l`, `Tab`, `1`-`3` | switch pane (spec / recent / history), wrapping |
| `j`/`k`, `↑`/`↓` | scroll the open pane |
| `Enter` | cross to the node's session (popup closes behind it) |
| `Esc` | close the popup |

## principles

- **Move by relationship, not geometry.** Navigation walks the parent/child/column structure (see [[node-graph]]), never raw pixel distance. `↑`/`↓` stay strictly within the focus node's column — depth pins x, so a column is a clean reversible vertical line. `hjkl` mirror the arrows for the vim hand. The one exception is a **leaf's right arrow**: with no child to dive into, rather than dead-end it steps to the nearest node in the columns to its right — and even there the distance is normalised into grid cells (so the wide column gap and the narrow row gap weigh equally), never raw pixels. It only ever moves rightward, so the parent key still walks you back.
- **The camera follows the keyboard, not the mouse.** Arrow nav recentres the viewport on the new node — a flat-pan at constant zoom, never zoom-to-fit. A mouse click only moves the highlight; the board stays put. Same focus state, two interaction logics.
- **A modal owns the keys.** While the popup, help overlay, settings, search palette, or session interface is open it captures every key — nav never leaks to the board behind it.

## search & jump

Relationship-walking reaches a deep node only by stepping its whole ancestor spine, and the board is a drill-down (see [[node-graph]]) — a node in a collapsed subtree is invisible until you arrive. `/` (slash-to-search) is the escape hatch, and it spans the board's **three planes at once**: spec nodes (the whole raw tree, not just visible ones), the live **sessions**, and the **issues** bound to nodes. All three are searched and ranked uniformly — name before id/number before path — and each row is tagged with its plane.

Picking **routes by kind**, landing on focus state you already understand: a **node** or an **issue** sets focus (an issue lands on the node it's bound to), and expand-on-focus opens that node's spine and pans the camera as the arrows would; a **session** jumps to its tab on the session board (see [[session-console]]), the boarding switch `Enter` performs. No new navigation concept on either route.

`o` / `O` is the same idea aimed at *change* rather than *name*: it cycles focus through the nodes a worktree is currently editing (those carrying an overlay — see [[node-graph]]), wrapping at the ends, so you can walk every in-flight edit without hunting for the marked tiles. Its **scope follows the lock**: with a session locked (see [[session-console]]) it walks just that session's changed nodes; with nothing locked, every in-flight edit on the board. Like `/`, each step just sets focus and lets expand-on-focus reveal a node buried in a collapsed subtree.

## focus & sessions

A node does **not** belong to a session. `node.session` is only the *last editor* (a "last edited by" attribution), never a live link. The live link is the overlay — the session(s) whose pending ops currently touch the node, marked on the board by a `⏎` affordance.

`Enter` crosses from *reading* a node to *driving* its agent, resolving by how many editors are live: **one** → jump straight in; **none** → open New Session prefilled with `@<node-id>`; **several** → open the session interface to pick which editor to drive.

The `@` key is the unconditional, spec-oriented counterpart to Enter: where Enter asks "drive whoever is editing this node" (and may board an existing session), it always opens a **fresh** New Session already targeting the focus — never resolving live editors. Like the node chords below, it pre-seeds the New Session input (here with only the focus mention) and leaves the launch to the human.

## node chords

`nn` (new child) and `dd` (delete) are **node ops on the focus**, never destructive on the live tree. A chord opens the session board's New Session input pre-seeded with an `@`-directive (`@new under @<parent>:` / `@delete @<node>:`); the human confirms, and the backend performs the op in a fresh worktree and dispatches an agent to finish it. The uncommitted mutation shows on the board's overlay at once.

## HUD & help

The HUD carries only the brand and a discreet `?`; while a session is locked, a top-center **lock banner** names the grip (in its colour) and points at `o`/`O` to walk its changed nodes — or, when it has none, says so, so the un-greyed board doesn't read as a broken lock. **`Esc` releases the lock** — the keyboard mirror of clicking the banner's release; it is the lone *board-level* `Esc`, firing only when no modal owns the keys and a session is actually locked, so a bare-board `Esc` is otherwise a no-op. The full keymap and the node's visual vocabulary (status dots, op glyphs, badges, rings) live together in **one** centered, scrollable modal — `?` opens it; `j`/`k` (or `↑`/`↓`) glide its body when it overflows the viewport; `Esc`, a backdrop click, or its `×` closes it. There is no second copy of the legend. That same `j`/`k` momentum glide drives the node-info popup's open pane — one shared scroller, not two copies.

## governed file

`App.jsx` — the app shell and the capture-phase keydown handler that routes every key to navigation or the active modal — is this node's single governed file. The graph it also renders is specified by [[node-graph]], but the file's reason to exist, and its churn, is the keyboard contract here.
