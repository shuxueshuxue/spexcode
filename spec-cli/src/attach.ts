// @@@ session attach - the HUMAN escape hatch into a worker: every session is just a tmux session on the
// backend's private socket, and the most direct way to see or rescue one is to sit in it. This verb is the
// sanctioned foreground `tmux attach` — no programmatic exception-handling ambition, the user fixes it by
// being there. It is deliberately the ONE session verb that does NOT route through the backend
// ([[remote-client]]'s exception): a terminal cannot be brokered over HTTP, and attaching a tmux CLIENT to
// the same server is tmux's native multi-client support, not a second actor on the socket. That makes it
// LOCAL-only by nature — the guards below fail loud (never degrade) when the premise doesn't hold.

// fails loud with the reason and the remote-capable alternatives, never a silent local fallback onto a
