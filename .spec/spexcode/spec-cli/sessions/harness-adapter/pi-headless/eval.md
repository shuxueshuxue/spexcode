    tags: [backend-api, cli]
    description: >-
      Launch a real pi-headless session through SpexCode with pi's built-in `--no-tools` flag. Ask the model
      for the exact uppercase titles of disciplines 2 and 4 from the preloaded SpexCode contract, without
      naming either title in the prompt. Capture the text-mode pane and pi session transcript.
    expected: >-
      The model answers `COMMIT BEFORE YOU DECLARE|KEEP THE LOSS SIGNAL HONEST` from startup context while
      no file or shell tool exists. Project trust and extension loading remain effective in print mode;
      artifact presence or a later file read is not accepted as proof.
  - name: pi-headless-materialized-skill-live
    tags: [backend-api, cli]
    description: >-
      Launch a real pi-headless session with `--no-tools` and invoke the discovered `taste` skill through
      pi's native `/skill:taste` command. Ask for the exact title of principle 14 and capture the expanded
      native skill invocation plus the model response from the real text-mode session.
    expected: >-
      Pi print mode resolves the materialized `.pi/skills/taste/SKILL.md`, expands the native slash
      invocation, and the model answers `Capabilities enter the ecosystem through the pillars we already
      stand on`; no file or shell tool is available to imitate skill loading.
  - name: pi-headless-real-loop
    description: >-
      Through a running backend and the real `pi-headless` launcher, create a session, observe the initial
      text-mode response, send a prompt after the turn is idle, then start a long tool turn and send a second
      prompt while the rendezvous listener is live.
    expected: >-
      The initial turn completes in pi's default text mode, idle delivery resumes the exact same session with
      `pi -p --session <id>`, and the active-turn delivery uses the existing rendezvous steer path exactly once;
      the public record remains online and reports `{ headless: true, messageStream: false }`.

  - name: pi-headless-close-residue
    description: Close the real pi-headless session through the public session API and inspect its process, tmux, worktree, sockets, and record store.
    expected: The controller and pi children stop, both controller and rendezvous sockets are gone, and the session worktree, branch, record, and store leave no residue.

      `spex session send`, then read the public timeline/board and the real pane where applicable.
    expected: >-
      Delivery is confirmed by the native product surface; the answer is readable as a timeline status note containing the answer marker;
      every observed liveness value is truthful for the live session; and a post-delivery authored
      declaration is present. A missing default note hint on a headless target is a failure.

    expected: >-
      The cell is reported BLOCKED because a launch first prompt creates its turn and cannot be
      injected into a pre-existing in-progress turn. The runner invents no substitute launch or
      private transport, and the remaining launch/idle cell carries launch-path coverage.

Measure with a real `pi-headless` launcher and public `spex session` verbs. Use a transcript for the backend/CLI
loop and include the exact session id, listener observations, and response markers; close is measured after the
session has been retired and the residue sweep has completed.
