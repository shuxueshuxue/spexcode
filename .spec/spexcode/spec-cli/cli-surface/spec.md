# cli-surface

## raw source

The `spex` top level is exactly the vocabulary a human or agent is meant to type — nothing more. A
verb only programs call (a generated hook, a launch script) does not sit beside the verbs people
learn; it lives under `spex internal`, out of sight. And no help probe may dead-end: from the map to
one command's usage to the guide, every layer names the next.

## expanded spec

**Porcelain-only top level.** `spex help`'s map lists every typeable command, grouped by the loop it
serves — *find & read the graph*, *author & verify* (the worker loop), *dispatch & manage sessions*
(the manager loop), *install & serve* (the operator loop) — so a newcomer learns not just what exists
but *when* each verb matters. Machine plumbing (`internal trunk` for the [[main-guard]] hook,
`internal codex-launch` / `internal codex-turn` for the [[harness-adapter]] launch script) is
namespaced under `spex internal`, absent from the map; its own usage text tells a stray human which
porcelain they probably wanted. Consequence of the move: a *stale installed* pre-commit hook that
still calls the old top-level token degrades to the hook's pure-git trunk fallback (advisory-safe),
and is healed by `npm run hooks`; the deprecated `spex propose` alias is gone the same way — a stale
post-merge hook prints one unknown-command line (advisory) until reinstalled.

**One verb, either drawer — the session-verb mirror.** A user must never have to guess whether a
session verb lives at the top level or under `spex session`: every promoted session verb
(`new · ls · watch · wait · review · merge`) also answers in its namespace form (`spex session
review` ≡ `spex review`), and every *typeable* `session` sub (`reopen · done · park · ask · exit ·
close · send · capture · attach · rename · rawkey · prompt`) also answers bare (`spex send` ≡
`spex session send`). The mirror is an **alias, never a second copy of the logic**: one argv rewrite
before the single dispatch normalizes either spelling to the canonical one, so `--help` probes,
flags, and positionals all flow through the same handler (a mirrored sub's probe answers with the
`session` entry). Hook-driven subs (`state · fail · idle · commit-gate`) stay namespace-only —
nobody types them. The map stays porcelain: mirrored spellings add no map lines; the `session`
entry lists the whole drawer, promoted verbs included, and states the equivalence both ways.

**The three-layer help journey** — each layer states what the next one is for, so the reader always
has a move:

1. `spex help` — the map. Also names the second layer (`spex help <command>`) and the guide topics.
2. `spex help <command>` / `spex <command> --help` — ONE command's usage: syntax, flags, semantics,
   a `see also:` pointing at its sibling verbs and guide topic, and a constant footer back to the map
   and the guide. The `--help` interception still fires BEFORE any verb runs ([[guide]]'s safety
   contract: probing `watch` or `session new` with `--help` must never start the verb) — what changed
   is that the probe now answers with *that command's* usage, not the whole map. Sub-namespace probes
   (`spex session send --help`) resolve to their namespace's entry; `resolve`/`retract` resolve to
   the `remark` entry they belong to.
3. `spex guide [topic]` — the skill layer ([[guide]]): workflows, file formats, settings. Guide pages
   footer back to `spex help`; the split is one sentence — **help answers "what do I type", guide
   answers "how do I work"**.

Dead-end rule: an unknown command, an unknown help topic, an unknown guide topic, and a bare
`spex internal` each fail loud AND name the layer to go back to — never a silent exit.

The map must stay honest: every porcelain verb `cli.ts` dispatches appears in it (a hidden typeable
verb is the bug this node exists to prevent — `search` and `owner` were exactly that), and each verb
with caveats carries them in its own entry (`watch` says it never exits and points at `wait`).
`cli.ts` remains the thin dispatch hub — verbs' logic lives in their own modules; help text lives in
`help.ts`; a sibling verb's churn in the hub is that feature's, not this node's drift.
