# spec-eval

The third SpexCode package, with [[spec-cli]], [[spec-dashboard]], and [[spec-forge]]. Read the system as
one optimization: **a spec is a loss-function design** (what we want), **issues/commits are the
optimizer** (driving the code toward it), and **eval is the evaluation** — the measured loss, how far
live behavior sits from the spec.

## A spec carries how to measure its loss

Beyond the target, a node's **`eval.md`** says how to measure the loss against it — one or more
scenarios, each: a **description** (what to check), the **expected** result (what zero loss looks like),
and optionally a **test file** beside it (a real `playwright.spec.ts`, a script — whatever runs). This is
the *measurement*, written next to the loss function. eval defines no DSL and runs nothing.

## The agent measures; eval keeps score

The **agent is the evaluator.** When a score is stale, the agent reads the scenario, runs it *however* —
the test file, by hand, a computer-use pass — compares the actual result to the expected, and files the
measurement: `spex eval add <node>` with the **evidence** it captured (a screenshot, a transcript) and
a **verdict** (met expected, or how far off). eval executes nothing; it only records the result.

eval **keeps score.** Measurements live in a flat git-tracked `evals.ndjson` beside the spec — a
*second git-as-database axis*: a measurement commit is an evaluation event, so history / attribution /
drift apply unchanged. A score is **stale** when its governed `code:` or its scenario
moved since — derived live from git, no stored hashes. Evidence bytes are content-addressed under the
shared git common dir (one blob per content, shared by every worktree, never committed; gone → "miss
original file").

- **`spex eval lint`** — the measurement layer's findings: which scores are stale or missing (pure
  advisory, always exit 0 — spec lint's errors block commits; a measurement gap never blocks anyone).
- **`spex eval add [.|<node>]`** — the agent files a measurement (evidence + verdict).
- **`spex eval scenario ls [<node>|.] [--unmeasured]`** — the declared contracts; `--unmeasured` is the
  blind-spot worklist.
- **`spex eval retract [.|<node>]`** — the sanctioned inverse of add: withdraw a botched filing by
  appending a retraction event (the sidecar stays append-only; the trace stays), so a junk e2e/smoke
  reading is reversible through the same surface that wrote it.
- **`spex eval ls [.|<node>] [--json]`** — read a node's scores; the same data the dashboard's eval
  tab renders (one engine, two faces).
- **`spex eval clean [--keep-latest|--all]`** — prune the evidence cache.

## Proactive — the optimizer keeps its scores fresh

eval is the loss signal the optimizer reads, so a stale score is a blind spot. The **`core` contract**
tells every agent: changed a node that has an `eval.md`? re-measure it. The **stop-gate** surfaces a
stale or missing score the way it surfaces code-drift, so the nudge lands in the flow, not on demand.
Only nodes that declare a scenario are in scope — a node with no surface to measure simply has none.

## What's next
The **computer-use "stupid user"** is the agent's most thorough measuring hand — it just looks. **Backend
eval** measures loss through real APIs ([[freshness]] reconcile waiting). Nothing in eval ever learns
*how* to test: the spec defines the loss, the agent measures it, the optimizer drives it down, eval
keeps score.
