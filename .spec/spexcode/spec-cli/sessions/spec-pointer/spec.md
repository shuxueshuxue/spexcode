# spec-pointer

## raw source

A session dispatched against an existing spec node should start already knowing **which spec is its ground
truth** — without the launcher pasting the spec body into the prompt. Inlining a snapshot bloats the launch
prompt toward the truncation limit and freezes a copy that goes stale the moment the agent edits the file.
A **path is enough**: hand the agent one line pointing at the spec, and it reads the live file itself.

## expanded spec

When [[launch]]'s `newSession` resolves a node ref — explicit `--node`, else the prompt's first `@mention` —
to a node that **already exists** in the committed spec tree, it appends **one line** to the launch prompt:
an **absolute path** to that node's `spec.md` **inside the new session's own worktree**. The ref is resolved
to its worktree-relative spec path against the spec index; since the worktree is freshly branched off main,
that relative path is identical there, so the absolute pointer is just the worktree dir joined with it.

Only the **pointer** is appended — never the spec **body**. The agent opens the live file, so it always sees
the current contract, and the launch prompt stays small (well under the shell-arg truncation limit [[launch]]
guards against). This is the plain-node companion to [[dispatch]]'s directive prompts: those rewrite the
launch prompt for `@new` / `@delete` ops, while this only **augments** an existing-node dispatch.

It is **fail-quiet by absence**: a `@new` placeholder (no committed id yet) and an unknown id resolve to
nothing, so no pointer is appended and the agent launches with the human's prompt unchanged. The directive
branches keep their own rewrites untouched — the pointer is added only on the otherwise-plain node dispatch.
