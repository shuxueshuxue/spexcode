desc: The ONE evidence+reply detail pane (U1), store-agnostic, reused in EVERY home — the Evals page ([[evals-view]]) AND the session eval tab. A selected reading as a WORKSPACE — slim header (verdict badge + A/B strip), the media STAGE center (video under a custom review-track scrubber; the human scrubs, circles; images/transcripts render whole), the REMARK track in a right RAIL — default-FOLDED to the shared fold strip ([[fold-toggle]]), unfolding on the strip or on any mark gesture — with the composer docked at its foot — circle on the stage, remark right there, no vertical ping-pong. The (node,scenario) remark track rides as entry.thread — a resolved remark renders settled, an open one prominent. The pane reads readings and hosts remarks; it never files one.

# event-detail

## raw source

The human's measuring hand on a recorded user loop: watch the clip, point at the moment something is
wrong, say what — and have that judgment land where it belongs, as one durable, conversable thing. This is
an authoring surface over an **already-captured** reading; eval still runs nothing, and no new ledger
structure exists for its sake. "Annotator" was never a real concept (U1): an annotation is just an anchored
**remark** on a video host, and the pane that shows it is just **the** evidence+reply detail. So there is ONE
`EventDetail` component, store-agnostic, reused in every home a reading is inspected — the Evals page
([[evals-view]]) and the session eval tab render the SAME media + remark thread + composer, never two
drifting surfaces.

## expanded spec

`EventDetail` IS the **detail pane for a selected eval reading** ([[evals-view]]'s master-detail — no
modal, no box-in-a-box: the reading gets the pane's full height, and switching selection resets the working
state to the new reading — the remark composer's draft included: the composer is keyed to the (node,
scenario) identity, so a half-typed or circle-prefilled remark dies with its selection instead of leaking
onto another eval's composer, where sending it would post one scenario's remark onto another scenario's
thread). The pane is a **WORKSPACE, not a scroll stack** — the review act is a loop
(*circle a moment on the clip, say what's wrong, circle the next*), and a layout that stacks
media→thread→composer vertically forces a scroll ping-pong between the frame (top) and the composer
(bottom) on every mark. So the pane splits into three fixed regions, the annotator shape: a **slim HEADER
band** (scenario · node · the verdict badge · timestamp · the FILER's liveness · the A/B strip
right-aligned), a center
**MEDIA STAGE**, and a **RIGHT RAIL** carrying the remark track with the composer **docked
at the rail's foot**. The rail is **default-FOLDED**: on arrival it renders as the shared thin fold
strip ([[fold-toggle]] — the same vertical-strip affordance every master list folds to, the one shared
component, no rail-specific drawing), badged with the remark count (accented while any remark is still
open, so the outstanding loss stays glanceable through the fold). It unfolds when the reviewer asks —
a click on the strip — or when the review act itself needs it: any mark gesture (a drag-circle on the
frame, the keyboard's `a`, selecting a remark via a scrubber marker or the ↑/↓ jump) lands in the rail,
so the gesture unfolds it on its own. The unfolded rail head carries the same shared inline fold badge
to fold it back, and the fold state persists across selection switches — a new selection neither
re-folds an opened rail nor re-opens a folded one. On the phone eval host, where the desktop folds
retire (stacking already gives the detail the full width), the rail simply stays open. The docked composer is [[issues-view]]'s ONE shared thread
composer: a QUIET BORDERED container whose BORDERLESS writing surface is already usable at idle —
floored at two lines, never a one-line sliver you must click to expand (the box you land on is the box
you write in) — auto-growing with the draft above that floor (capped so it never eats the rail), over a
PERSISTENT compact action row carrying only real acts: the grammar's `@` / `[[` / `/` discoverability buttons
(each types its exact trigger at the caret so the shared autocomplete opens — [[mentions]], no second
menu), the contextual ⏱ anchor stamp and the icon-only
Send pinned at the row's right edge. The `@`/`[[`/`/` menus open as overlays ABOVE the container, never
inside it — so the write affordance is permanent, usable on sight, and never bulky. Stage and rail scroll *independently* — the media never scrolls out of view while
remarking, and the composer is never below the fold: circle→remark→circle→remark without moving anything.
At narrow widths the workspace degrades gracefully back to one stacked column (the rail folds under the
stage), and the composer stays a **sticky bar at the column's foot** — the one-column mode keeps the
docked-writer geometry instead of burying the composer under the thread. The header's **filer chip** names the session that FILED this scenario's reading, with a liveness dot
(alive = the session is on the board and not offline, its live `STATUS_COLOR` painting the dot, [[state]];
offline otherwise). A live filer chip is the direct door to the session's CONSOLE: click it and the
dashboard opens `#/sessions/<id>` with the terminal showing. On the session eval tab — where the filer is
routinely the very session being viewed — the host makes that meaning real by flipping its right pane to
the terminal ([[session-console]]), so a same-session click is never a dead no-op. Offline filers stay static, and the header
does not spell out the courtesy-delivery mechanics in a reach phrase. The filer is the LATEST reading's
`by` (the chain's first link; the reading carries it from the eval seam via `evalTimeline`); a legacy reading
without `by` resolves to nobody and the header simply shows no filer.

A reading's evidence is a **LIST**, so every entry renders on the ONE stage — and U1's "one evidence
detail" is literal code: the per-entry renderer is the extracted **`Evidence.jsx`**, this node's second
file — one kind-dispatch (`EvidenceItem`: video → an inline player, image → click-to-enlarge, transcript →
text, a pruned blob → the honest miss sentinel) reused verbatim by the node eval tab's gallery
([[eval-tab]]'s `NodeView`) and by a reply's inline blob links ([[issues-view]]'s `Thread`, which
resolves a bare hash's kind from the blob route's served Content-Type), so a blob renders identically
wherever it appears. The ONE deliberate specialization is this pane's **clip player**: on this stage the
**video** plays under a **custom review-track scrubber** — native chrome replaced so the timeline can
carry the review: anchored remarks are **markers** on it, the playhead **lights the remark it is inside**,
and clicking a marker (or a remark in the rail) **seeks** there. The surface is **keyboard-driven** — play/pause,
coarse and frame-fine scrubbing, jump between remarks, and **annotate the current frame** (its
`▶m:ss · step` and the captured frame itself stamped into the composer). Because that custom bar **replaces** native chrome — its
built-in fullscreen included — the bar carries an explicit **fullscreen control**: the ONE shared
`FullscreenButton` ([[video-evidence]]'s `Evidence.jsx`), `requestFullscreen` on the whole player wrapper
(stage + bar, so the review-track controls stay usable large). It exists on every media home a *video*
renders: a plain `<video controls>` (the eval-tab gallery, a thread's blob link) gets fullscreen from its
native controls, and only a controls-suppressed player (this clip player) grows the explicit button — one
control, never doubled where the native chrome already offers it. An **image gallery** renders on the stage beside/under the clip —
each still full-width and **click-to-enlarge** (a click opens that blob in a viewport-size lightbox; click
anywhere or Esc closes, the Esc swallowed so the page's own Esc stack never fires — a screenshot's detail is
the evidence, and the stage's width is not its ceiling). A transcript entry renders as
text, a missing blob as the honest sentinel per entry, a blob-less (`note`) reading its verdict note as the text
body (never an empty media box). A **structured `data`** entry ([[evidence-kind-taxonomy]]) renders as its
validatable block, but **FOLDS behind its own header when the reading ALSO carries a clip or still** — the
media is the protagonist and the data a secondary drill-down, so it must not push the video/gallery off the
stage; a **data-only** reading keeps it open, since the block IS the evidence (a native fold, no JS state).
When the reading
carries a [[step-timeline]]
sidecar, a **step ruler** renders naming each step at its position — labels keyed by the map's **axis**
(time→m:ss, frame→#123, line→L42, index→3/N), so the rail is no longer welded to the clip: a **non-video**
reading (a transcript's `line` steps) shows its rail too. On a **video** (the `time` axis) the scrubber also
**bands its step boundaries** and a live chip names the step the playhead is in, and clicking a ruler step
seeks to its position; a remark at position P names its step by the last-boundary-≤P lookup, and a step's
optional owning-node routes the finding to the node it actually belongs to. Without a sidecar it is a plain
player/evidence view with remarks — degraded gracefully, never blocked.

**The A/B strip — a scenario's fail→pass lifecycle, walkable in place.** A bug fix leaves a *pair* of
readings on one scenario — the **A** (the reproduced failure) and the **B** (the verified fix), the
[[reproduce-before-fix]] contract's proof-of-work — and the error→correct transition is only legible when
you can see both. So the pane is not pinned to the latest reading: in the header band a compact **A/B strip**
renders the scenario's WHOLE reading history as verdict pips (oldest→newest, ✗ = a fail/A pole, ✓ = a
pass/B pole, · = a pre-verdict legacy reading), the viewed one lit, with **‹ ›** to walk older→newer and a
click on any pip to jump. Flipping swaps the media *in place* — the video/gallery, the step ruler, the
expected, the verdict note, and the header's verdict badge all re-render for the selected reading — so A
(the bug) and B (the fix) sit one keystroke apart.

**A stale reading is shown, so the detail EXPLAINS its staleness.** Because the feeds no longer hide stale
readings ([[evals-feed]]), a stale one is routinely the viewed reading — and a bare "stale" is not enough to
act on. So the stage carries a small **stale readout** for a non-fresh viewed reading: the freshness axes that
moved since it (`code · scenario · remark`), and for the **code** axis which governed files drifted
and by **how many commits** (`EvalsFeed.jsx +3`) — the per-file drift count is [[eval-core]]'s `codeDrift`,
attached to the reading by `evalTimeline` (the frontend has no git). It is reporting only: it never decides
freshness, it names a decision already made, so a reviewer sees *why* a reading is behind and by how far. Every
other affordance is freshness-blind — a remark is authored on a stale reading exactly as on a fresh one (the
composer never consults freshness); staleness changes what the loss signal *says*, never what the human can *do*. The A/B
history is **HOME-PROVIDED, so it shares each home's ROOT** — the store-agnostic pane never assumes one timeline
source. The [[evals-view]] page passes none and the pane lazily fetches the node's `/api/specs/:id/evals`
timeline the [[eval-tab]] uses (the board folds only the latest reading per scenario, [[graph-lean]], so
walking the poles needs this one read). The **session eval tab** instead supplies its already-computed
**WORKTREE-rooted** readings for the scenario ([[session-eval]]) — because on that home the selected reading is
the session's own **un-merged in-session** reading, which lives in the branch's worktree and is therefore ABSENT
from the main-checkout `/api/specs` timeline; re-fetching it there would strand the current video behind an
older inherited reading and disable the newer-nav. Either way there is no new endpoint and no board bloat; the
strip shows only when a scenario has more than one reading (a fresh scenario is just its single reading). The remark track in the rail is
per-SCENARIO, not per-reading, so it stays stable as you flip — it spans the whole A/B. New readings
arrive only from the eval seam's CLI ([[eval-core]]'s `spex eval add`) and surface here on the next
refresh; the pane never mutates or appends the scenario's history itself.

**One reply primitive — a REMARK on the eval's own (node, scenario) thread.** Discussion and annotation are
the same act, and on a scenario that act is a **remark** ([[remark-substrate]]) — a scenario-scoped concern
is never an issue (I1: else the loss signal could be bypassed). The rail renders the eval's thread
([[issues-view]]'s shared `Thread`), and every mark is a remark on it, carrying the mutable `resolved` bit.
The track is the thread's **remarks** — the `rid`-carrying replies — NOT its container root: an eval thread's
body is a system-minted stub (`Remarks on the <scenario> eval of <node>`) that find-or-create writes to
close the race window, and it is never a remark ([[remark-substrate]]: every remark is a reply, never the
thread body), so it renders as neither a track row nor a count — the rail shows exactly the remarks, once each.
A remark is **anchored** by a prose convention — the same philosophy as `Spec:` and `[[node]]` — a body
whose first line reads `▶m:ss · <step>` IS anchored to that video moment: the renderer linkifies it (click
seeks the clip), and the composer over a clip gains a **⏱** affordance that stamps the current frame — its
time + the ≤T step name from the timeline, AND the frame itself as the mark's image. Sorted by their anchor, the anchored remarks **are** the review
track over the clip — the Frame.io/YouTube-time-comment shape, literally the markers on the scrubber, the
active one lit as it plays. A remark's **`resolved` state renders in place** ([[remark-teeth]]): an open
remark is prominent (the loss the eval scoreboard is still carrying), a resolved one is visually settled
(dimmed, ✓) — the eval's outstanding loss is legible at a glance, not hidden in a badge. The bit is also
**writable in place, at CLI parity** ([[remark-substrate]] LAW L): an unresolved remark row carries its one
applicable verb — **resolve** on an agent's remark (the human's deliberate second-party judgment, the same
`/api/remarks/resolve` an agent's `spex resolve` parallels; never on the human's own, mirroring the
server's self-resolve rejection) or **retract** on the human's own (author-only withdrawal). A resolved
remark is settled and immutable — monotonic, no verb — and a refused action surfaces its server message on
the row. The reload rides the host's existing write path, so the teeth clear on the same signal a filed
remark fires.

**An anchored mark carries its moment's frame — whichever gesture made it.** The three mark gestures
(a drag-**circle** on the paused frame, the composer's **⏱** stamp, the keyboard's **`a`**) are ONE act
through one capture: grab the current frame to the blob store (the circle burns its rect in; ⏱/`a` take
the clean frame) and anchor a remark carrying it — the `▶m:ss · step` line, the frame as a
`![frame](/api/evidence/<hash>)` image link in the body, and — when the step's owning node differs — a
`[[node]]` routing line (circle/`a` prefill the composer; ⏱ stamps the head of the draft in place,
keeping the prose, and a re-stamp at a new moment replaces the anchor line AND its riding frame together,
so an anchor and its frame never disagree — only a frame sitting right under the anchor line is the
anchor's own; frames deeper in the prose are the author's). So the review track renders uniformly: every
anchored remark is chip + frame thumbnail (+ prose), a ⏱/`a` mark indistinguishable in shape from a
circle mark. A failed capture degrades to the text-only anchor (the capture flash reports it), never a
blocked mark. The frame's hash, derived from that body link, is the remark's typed `evidence[]` on the
thread; the body is the one raw-readable source. A mark is thereafter an ordinary reply — replyable,
`@`-able: `circle + @new fix this` is a timestamped, framed assign, the anchor riding into the dispatched
worker's prompt verbatim.

**The pane is READ-side on readings — it files none.** A reading's verdict renders (the header badge, the
A/B pips, the note) but is never authored here: readings are filed by AGENTS through the eval seam's CLI
(`spex eval add`, [[eval-core]]) *with evidence* — a human pass/fail click would file an evidence-less
`manual@1` hand-vote, ruled useless, so the pane carries no verdict footer. The human's judgment speaks
through the REMARK composer: an open remark ages the scenario like a drift event ([[remark-teeth]]), so a
human "this is wrong" reaches the loss signal without minting a blind reading. A finding belonging to
*another* node is an anchored remark routing to that node's thread ([[video-evidence]]'s routing). This
pane invents no verdict states, no timeline tables, no locks.

**The thread rides one server-side overlay — folded in as `entry.thread`, the SAME on both homes.** The
eval's remark track IS the ONE local Issue for this (node, scenario), keyed by its `eval: <node> · <scenario>`
concern. It is no longer re-matched client-side against a resident issues list: the (node,scenario)↔thread
join is the server overlay ([[remark-teeth]] / [[eval-issue-split]]), attached to each reading by
`evalTimeline` and so present on **every** home — the Evals-page feed folds it in through the board, the
session tab through the proof model. The composer authors a **remark** through the CLI-parity `/api/remarks`
(find-or-create by (node, scenario) — no thread id or concern needed on the write side; identity is
server-derived `'human'`, L: no dashboard-only write): the first remark mints the thread, every later one
appends; an `@session`/`@new` typed in it dispatches ([[mentions]]), and a `/` at the line's start opens the
review track's typed command menu ([[review-commands]] — /ok as the ONE dashboard door to the [[human-ok]]
sign-off (the header carries only the settled ok'd mark, no button), `surface: review` presets as prefills;
the send stays this same remark write). Because the write path needs no resident
list, the pane renders on **EVERY** eval home — a fresh scenario shows an empty track with a live composer,
and the session eval tab's old "no resident issues list" degradation is gone (it now renders the full thread
+ composer like the issues page). The reply list and composer are the SAME shared thread UI the issue detail
uses ([[issues-view]]'s `Thread.jsx` — one thread UI, three homes: local issue, forge issue, eval reading).
