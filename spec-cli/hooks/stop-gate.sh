# @@@ stop-gate - a blocking Stop hook with TWO jobs, each with a HARD loop-break (never blocks more than
# once on the same cause, never leaks a dishonest stop):
#   (A) COMMIT GATE — a done/merge proposal (awaiting + merge|nothing) is rejected while the node branch has
#       uncommitted work or 0 commits ahead of main; the dogfood ritual commits BEFORE proposing. Clean ->
#       allow; dirty -> block once with the reason, escape on the continuation to honest `blocked`.
#   (B) DECLARE GATE — a session may not stop in an undeclared (`active`) state:
#         declared (awaiting/blocked/error/needs-input) . allow (the agent reported; nothing to do)
#         active, first stop  (stop_hook_active false) .. block ONCE — instruct the agent to declare
#         active, the continuation (stop_hook_active true) auto-declare a safe default (awaiting/nothing if
#                                                          committed, else blocked) and allow. Guaranteed to end.
# $SPEX is the PATH-independent CLI invocation (abs tsx + cli) injected by settingsArg, so the gate's
# own auto-default AND the command it shows the agent both work even when `spex` is absent from PATH.
# Runs with cwd = the session worktree; state is the deterministic, file-based .session.

# @@@ commit gate - a declaration of done/merge (awaiting + proposal merge|nothing) is only honest once the
# node branch carries the work as COMMITS: the dogfood ritual commits spec+code BEFORE any proposal, yet a
# dashboard-launched agent kept proposing merge with 0 commits / a dirty tree. So before allowing such a
# declaration we run the deterministic check (`spex session commit-gate`, which goes through git.ts's git()
# so the hook's GIT_DIR/GIT_INDEX_FILE can't misdirect repo discovery). Clean -> allow. Dirty/0-ahead ->
# block ONCE with the specific reason + commit instructions; on the forced continuation (the agent ignored
# it) escape the loop by downgrading to `blocked` with a clear note, so a FALSE "ready to merge" never
# stands. (A propose-close declaration is exempt — it discards the worktree, so commits are moot.)
