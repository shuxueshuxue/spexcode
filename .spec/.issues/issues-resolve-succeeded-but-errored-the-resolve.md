concern: issues resolve succeeded-but-errored: the resolve wrote+committed (1479f632, status: landed) yet the CLI exited non-zero with 'Command failed: git -C ... commit --no-verify ...' — an aborted chained command mistook a landed resolve for a failure. Looks like a second internal commit attempt hitting nothing-to-commit (or a double-fire); the write path should be one atomic commit or tolerate an already-clean tree, and exit 0 when the store state IS the requested state.

(no detail given — issues resolve succeeded-but-errored: the resolve wrote+committed (1479f632, status: landed) yet the CLI exited non-zero with 'Command failed: git -C ... commit --no-verify ...' — an aborted chained command mistook a landed resolve for a failure.

ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED (deterministic, not intermittent): a NO-CHANGE store write. writeStoreFile does write→add→'git commit -- <file>'; when the requested state already equals stored state (duplicate resolve — the original trigger was worker 4c950d18 resolving its own issue at 11:34:58/1479f632 while my concurrent duplicate lost the store-lock race), the bytes don't change and 'git commit' exits 1 'nothing to commit', which git()'s execFileSync surfaces as a thrown failure. Repro (100%): 'spex issues resolve dashboard-issues-spec-body-claims-not-visually-v --as landed' on the already-landed thread → exit 1 with the exact observed error. Fix direction: commitStore/writeStoreFile must treat store-state-already-equals-requested as SUCCESS — detect the no-op (compare serialized bytes, or 'git diff --cached --quiet -- rel' after add) and report 'already <state>' with exit 0; never let an idempotent write reach a failing commit.

Fix built on node/issues-idempotent-write-6a82 (merge proposed): writeStoreFile now detects the no-op after staging (staged == HEAD → git status silent on the path) and skips the commit; commitStore surfaces changed:false and resolve reports "already <state>" with exit 0. Generic across the write path — duplicate sign is idempotent too, and a genuine write still lands as exactly one commit. A/B proof on local-issues yatsu scenario 'idempotent-write': A fail @ 96e2247 (the thread's repro command, exit 1 nothing-to-commit), B pass (same command → 'already landed — store unchanged', exit 0, trunk HEAD untouched).
