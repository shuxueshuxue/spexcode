# @@@ spec-first - a ONE-SHOT PreToolUse nudge, wired alongside mark-active. The FIRST time a session
# ACCESSES code — READS or mutates a non-spec file — WITHOUT having touched its spec, it blocks once to
# remind: read the node's spec AND its neighbors first, then reconcile against it (change the spec, or make
# the code honor it) — never silently diverge. It once fired only on code-MUTATING tools, which let a pure
# understanding/analysis session sail past it entirely (the grounding gap): an agent reasoned straight from
# the code without ever opening the contract. Widening the trigger to Read closes that — grounding should
# precede understanding, not just editing. The sentinel makes it fire at most once per session; the
# re-issued tool call passes. An agent whose first code touch IS its spec — reading or editing it — is
# blessed silently: doing it right never earns a nag. Pure shell (no node/tsx), cwd = the session worktree.
# Only ever wired into post-runtime-dir sessions, so it assumes the `.session/` layout.
