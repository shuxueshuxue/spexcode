  • only mechanics changed  → spex spec ack <node>   "checked — spec still valid"   (give a real reason)

  • wrong code: link        → the node shouldn't own this file (or owns it too broadly); fix frontmatter
  • expanded spec ≠ raw     → the spec drifted from human intent; fix the expanded spec to serve the raw
  • structural mismatch     → one file owned by many specs / a feature with no home: refactor so a file
                              maps to a node, or file an issue and link it (defer honestly)
