    tags: [frontend-e2e]
    description: >-
      Through the REAL dashboard New-Session box (the product surface a human uses to launch a worker),
      measure the launcher pick on a project whose config defines `sessions.launchers` (e.g. `reclaude` →
      claude, `codex` → codex) with a `defaultLauncher`. Load the dashboard, open the New-Session box, and
      read the DOM: assert a launcher `<select class="si-launcher-select">` is present, one `<option>` per
      available profile, and that the `.si-agent-picker` harness radiogroup is ABSENT. Cross-check the source
      data at `GET /api/launchers`. Then, on a project with no custom launchers but an explicit
      `sessions.defaultLauncher: "claude"`, confirm the same select still renders with the built-in `claude`
      and `codex` options and the harness radios are still absent. Screenshot the New box.
    expected: >-
      Launchers configured → the New box shows the `.si-launcher-select` dropdown with exactly one option
      per profile, the harness radiogroup is gone, and the chosen launcher name is what the New-Session POST
      sends (backend derives the harness from it). No custom launchers but an explicit default → the same
      dropdown is still present with built-in `claude`/`codex` options, and no plain harness radios render.
      `GET /api/launchers` returns the same `{name, harness}` list the dropdown renders. A launcher subsumes
      the harness axis; picking one is the single choice the human makes.

    tags: [frontend-e2e, desktop]
    description: >-
      Through the REAL dashboard New-Session box, measure that the launcher dropdown's INITIAL selection
      honors the configured `sessions.defaultLauncher` (not the alphabetically-first launcher). Stand up a
      project whose config defines several launchers where the default is NOT the alphabetically-first — e.g.
      `sessions.launchers = { "aaa": …, "reclaude": … }` with `sessions.defaultLauncher: "reclaude"`. With
      localStorage CLEARED (no remembered `si.launcher`), load the dashboard, open the New-Session box, and
      read the dropdown's selected value: `document.querySelector('.si-launcher-select').value`. Cross-check
      the source at `GET /api/launchers` — it must report `{ launchers:[…], default:"reclaude" }`. Then set
      a remembered pick (`localStorage.setItem('si.launcher','aaa')`), reload, and confirm the still-valid
      remembered pick now wins over the default. Screenshot the composer in the fresh (defaulted) state.
    expected: >-
      On a fresh browser (no remembered pick) the dropdown pre-selects `reclaude` — the configured
      `defaultLauncher` — NOT `aaa` (the alphabetically-first), so the dashboard default AGREES with the CLI
      default (`spex new` with no `--launcher` also uses `reclaude`). `GET /api/launchers` returns
      `{ launchers, default }` with `default:"reclaude"`. When a still-valid launcher is remembered in
      localStorage that remembered pick wins instead; only when nothing is remembered (or the remembered one
      no longer exists) does the configured default drive the initial selection. It never falls back to the
      first launcher when no default is configured; that state is a configuration error. The old behaviour
      (silently selecting `d[0]`, disagreeing with the config default) is gone.

  - name: missing-default-launcher-refuses-create
    tags: [backend-api, frontend-e2e]
    description: >-
      Through the real create surfaces, measure a project whose config exposes launcher profiles but omits
      `sessions.defaultLauncher`. Run `spex new "probe"` with no `--launcher`, POST `/api/sessions` with no
      `launcher`, and load the dashboard New-Session box from the same backend. Cross-check `GET
      /api/launchers`.
    expected: >-
      `GET /api/launchers` still returns the available `{name, harness}` profiles, but its `default` is null
      and it carries a configuration error telling the human to write `sessions.defaultLauncher` in
      `spexcode.json` or `spexcode.local.json`. The CLI/API create with no launcher fails with that same
      actionable error, without creating a worktree and without falling back to the built-in `claude` launcher.
      The dashboard surfaces the error under the launcher picker and refuses to submit while the default is
      missing. An explicit `--launcher <name>` remains a named choice, not a fallback.

  - name: launcher-persisted-not-badged-on-board
    tags: [frontend-e2e, desktop]
    description: >-
      Through the REAL dashboard, measure that a session's launcher is DURABLE DATA but is NOT rendered as a
      per-session board badge (the badge was removed as visual clutter). Drive a real browser at the dashboard
      and feed the session list a session whose `/api/board` (and `/api/sessions`) payload carries a
      `launcher` (e.g. `launcher: "claude-glm"`, `harness: "claude"`) — the exact data that WOULD have drawn
      the old badge. Open the session list (the map-side SessionWindow and the console's own list) and read
      the DOM: assert NO `.sess-launcher` element renders on any row (the badge is gone from the component
      entirely), while the row itself still renders normally. Cross-check the source: the `launcher` field IS
      still present on the board/sessions payload (the data is kept, only the board render is dropped).
      Screenshot the clean list (no launcher badges).
    expected: >-
      No session row shows a launcher badge — `document.querySelectorAll('.sess-launcher').length === 0` even
      for a session whose payload carries a `launcher` — so the board reads clean, without a harness glyph +
      name on every row. The `launcher` field remains on the session's board/sessions payload (persisted and
      API-exposed for any surface that needs it); the wrong-launcher confusion is closed at create time by the
      default-honoring picker ([[dropdown-honors-default-launcher]]), not by after-the-fact board badging. The
      old per-row `.sess-launcher` / `.sess-launcher-name` / `.si-agent-glyph` badge is gone.

  - name: resume-replays-original-launcher-not-current-default
    tags: [backend-api]
    description: >-
      Create a governed session under launcher A (whose `cmd` wrapper sets a specific config-dir env — e.g.
      `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/root/.claude`). Then CHANGE the ambient default to launcher B with a DIFFERENT
      config dir (a new `SPEXCODE_CLAUDE_CMD` / `defaultLauncher`), exactly as a backend restart onto a
      different default would. Take the session offline and resume it (reopen); inspect the regenerated
      `launch.sh` and the resolved launch command. Do this for BOTH a named-launcher session and an UNNAMED
      (zero-config default) session.
    expected: >-
      The (re)launch replays launcher A's EXACT pinned command (its config-dir env intact), NOT the current
      default B — so `--resume` looks in A's config dir and FINDS the conversation. `launch.sh` is NOT
      rewritten to B. This holds for the UNNAMED session too: whatever command launched it is frozen on the
      record (`launch_cmd`) at creation and replayed verbatim. Before the pin, an unnamed/default session
      re-resolved ambiently and resumed under B's config dir → "No conversation found" (the resume-death half
      of the mass-restore incident, where victims' `launch.sh` were rewritten to a different launcher while
      their transcripts lived under the original's config dir).

# yatsu.md — launcher-select

Measured YATU-style through the running dashboard, not by reading the JSX: drive a real browser at a
deployment whose `spexcode.local.json` configures named launchers (the gugu board — `reclaude` + `codex`)
and read the live New-Session DOM, then contrast it against a no-custom-launcher board whose
`defaultLauncher` explicitly names a built-in `claude`/`codex` option. The loss watched is the launcher pick
failing to be the ONLY launch choice — either the dropdown missing (the human can't pick their auth path,
silently gets the global default), the harness radios lingering beside it (two controls for one decision), or
a missing `defaultLauncher` silently falling through to built-in `claude` instead of producing an actionable
configuration error.
