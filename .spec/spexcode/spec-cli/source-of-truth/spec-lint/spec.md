# spec-lint

## raw source

A spec is the ground truth for the code it governs, but nothing tied the two together, so code could
drift from its spec silently. The missing edge is a `code:` list in each node's frontmatter naming the
files it owns, plus a linter over that graph. Keep the spec↔code **graph** honest; whether the code
still matches what the spec *says* is the LLM judge's job, async, not in the commit path. It also flags a
body slid **below contract altitude** into a mechanics dump, and a node fanned out into too many direct
children — one comprehensibility ceiling, on depth and breadth.

## expanded spec

`spex lint` (the `spex` CLI, `cli.ts` → `lint.ts`, over `loadSpecs()` from `specs.ts`) checks six
rules:

- **integrity** (error): every file a spec lists in `code:` exists — broken links block.
- **living** (error): a body stays current-state, with no `## vN` changelog headings — version history
  is read from git (recent/history tabs), not duplicated in prose. Fence-aware: a `## v2` inside a ```
  block is sample text, not a violation.
- **coverage** (warn): every governed source file is claimed by ≥1 spec (no orphan code); and roots
  matching no files are flagged "governing nothing", so an adopter who never set `lint.governedRoots`
  isn't shown a falsely-clean board.
- **drift** (warn): a governed file has commits newer than its spec's latest version → maybe stale.
- **altitude** (warn): a body states *intent and contract*, not a re-narration of the implementation.
  The rule can't judge meaning, so it fires on cheap proxies of a mechanics dump — grown long (lines /
  chars over a soft budget), thick with code identifiers, or step-by-step how-to. Budgets default so
  concise specs pass and only a dump warns.
- **breadth** (warn): a node has fewer than `lint.maxChildren` direct children (default 8). Altitude's
  structural twin — the same "hold it in your head" limit on the tree's breadth, not a body's depth, so
  passing altitude can't just relocate the sprawl into a flat fan-out. Advisory: a flat list of true
  peers is sometimes right, so it asks whether a grouping is missing rather than mandates one.

Reusable as a **product**, not a SpexCode-only script: every project-shaped value — governed roots,
source and code-identifier extensions, altitude budgets, the breadth limit — is read from an optional
**`spexcode.json`** (`lint` key), defaulting to values tuned to this tree; a different layout or language
overrides what fits, and absent the file lint is unchanged.

No file hashes are stored — git is the hash database, so drift is derived live. When
drift exists, `spex lint` prints **remediation guidance**: drift can't be auto-fixed, so the agent must
find which link of intent→spec→link→structure→code broke and fix THAT — *never patch the symptom*.
**Gated with no flag:** `spex lint` reads the staged index — nothing staged (CI, see [[ci-gate]], and
manual audit) keeps drift advisory; mid-commit it applies a **commit-local gate**, blocking a commit
whose staged files belong to a node `≥ lint.driftErrorThreshold` (default 3) behind. Errors always
block; bypass with `SPEXCODE_SKIP_LINT=1`.

### Spec-OK — acknowledging an implementation-only change

Not every commit ahead of a spec means the spec is stale — a refactor can change a governed file while
the spec stays true. Such a commit may carry a **`Spec-OK: <node-id>`** trailer (*"keeps `<node>`'s spec
valid"*); drift skips a commit that acknowledges the node it's measured from, so `Spec-OK: A` only quiets
A's drift, never B's.

`spex ack <node-id>… --reason "<why>"` (`cli.ts`) stamps the trailer onto **HEAD** (`--amend`, beside
`Session:`), taking several nodes in one amend so a commit to a shared file acks every co-owner.
`--reason` is **required but not stored** — git keeps only `Spec-OK: <node>`; it forces the agent to
*articulate* why each spec still holds before quieting it.

A sharp edge: git calls inside the hook must route through `git.ts`'s `git()` helper, which strips the
inherited `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_INDEX_FILE` — else repo discovery resolves to the cwd and lint silently sees
zero specs (caught only by testing the real hook, not `spex lint` by hand).
