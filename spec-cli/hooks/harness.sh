# harness deterministically, never by sniffing the payload shape. EVERY harness-divergent payload-parse lives
# HERE; the hook scripts stay harness-agnostic and just call hp_* (the one place Claude's tool names appear in
# shell, plus codex's Bash-command mapping). The session-id + global-store resolution is harness-agnostic and

# mints its OWN thread id (un-pinnable), so the record can't be keyed by it — instead the launcher keys the
# record by a SpexCode id and exports it into the launch, and every hook resolves THAT. Claude's payload id is
# already the record id, so the env (= same value) is a harmless no-op there. A self-launched agent sets no

# A MUTATION is a patch envelope or a write shape (a redirect, tee, `sed -i`, dd of=); in `mutate` mode a pure
# read yields nothing. The path is the last path-like token (has a / or a .ext), ignoring flags — matches the
