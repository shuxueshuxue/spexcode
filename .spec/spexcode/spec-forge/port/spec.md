desc: The host-agnostic forge port (ForgeDriver) that READS a host's issues (open + closed, comments included) and open PRs, and WRITES through issue verbs (createIssue for promotion, createComment for replies, closeIssue for lifecycle close), plus its first real driver — github via the gh CLI.

# port

The seam of [[spec-forge]]: a single **host-agnostic port** naming the abstraction, with **per-host
drivers** behind it. The name is the seam, never the vendor.

Unlike a projection, the port **reads the forge**. Its two verbs fetch a host's work objects —
`listIssues() → ForgeIssue[]` (issues of **all** states, so closed work stays linkable, not just live
issues) and `listPRs() → ForgePR[]` (open PRs). `ForgeIssue` is the small stable subset an
issue collapses to on every host (number, title, body, url, state, labels, author, createdAt — the body is
where the `Spec: <id>` marker lives; author/createdAt are what lets a forge issue stand beside a local issue
thread as the same object in the unified Issue port, spec-cli's [[issues]], with a `by` and a `created`).
It also carries the issue's **comments** (`ForgeComment[]`: author, createdAt, body — exactly what becomes
a unified Issue's `replies[]`), riding the same list reads, not a second fetch path: the gh list
asks for the `comments` JSON field (heavier per call, covered by [[freshness]]'s TTL), and the incremental
window — whose REST rows carry only a comment *count* — fetches each **commented** updated issue's thread
alongside (a since-window is a handful of issues, so that stays a handful of calls).
`ForgePR` adds `headRefName` (the `node/<id>` branch = a free structural link)
and `closesIssues` (the issue numbers it closes, for transitive linking). These vendor-neutral shapes are
what let one port cover any host. A driver may also offer the **optional
incremental window** `listIssuesSince(sinceISO)` — only issues updated since that moment — which lets
[[freshness]]'s resident cache merge small deltas instead of full-listing every cycle; a driver without it
is simply always full-listed. State casing is normalized to lowercase **at the driver** — platform
differences (gh's GraphQL `OPEN` vs REST `open`) die at the adapter, never downstream.

A driver is the **only** thing that touches the network/CLI; it does no link resolution (that is
host-agnostic, in [[links]]). The first real driver is **`github`**, which wraps the **`gh` CLI** — reusing
the user's existing auth and `gh`'s repo auto-detection rather than handling tokens itself. It **fails
loud**: an absent or unauthenticated `gh` throws with gh's own message, so a broken `gh` never looks like
an empty forge.

**One caveat, scoped to a single optional field.** `closesIssues` rides GitHub's `closingIssuesReferences`,
a `gh pr list` JSON field that older `gh` builds don't know. Only the **transitive** link needs it; the two
core links (the `node/<id>` PR branch and the `Spec:` issue marker) read baseline fields. So a `gh` too old
for that one field must degrade **only** transitive linking, never take the whole driver down — otherwise
[[freshness]]'s resident cache swallows the throw and the dashboard goes blank ([[dashboard-issues]]). The
driver asks for the field and, **only** on gh's specific "unknown JSON field" rejection, retries without it
(`closesIssues` empty) and warns once; every other failure (no `gh`, no auth, no repo) still throws loud —
the degrade is that narrow field-version case alone, never a blanket swallow.

The port carries three **write verbs**, existing solely so the unified Issue port's cross-store actions
(spec-cli's [[issues]]) go through this same seam — the driver stays the ONLY thing that touches the
network, writes included, rather than a second vendor call-site growing in product code:
`createIssue({title, body}) → {number, url}` (promotion: a local thread moving to the forge; gh wraps
`gh issue create`) and `createComment({number, body}) → {url}` (the store-routed reply: commenting on a
forge issue from any SpexCode surface; gh wraps `gh issue comment`) and
`closeIssue({number}) → {url}` (the store-routed lifecycle close: closing a forge issue from the unified
Issues page; gh wraps `gh issue close`). All fail loud. The **tracer**
(links/freshness/the board fold) remains read-only end to end, and the deeper contract is untouched:
nothing here ever writes a node's version or status (which stays git-derived) — a created issue or
comment or closed issue is execution-plane work, never graph state.

Out of scope: link resolution ([[links]]), the CLI surface ([[forge-cli]]), and any second driver
(gitlab/bitbucket wrapping their own CLI later).
