# @@@ stop-gate - a blocking Stop hook that forces the agent to author its own state, with a HARD
# loop-break. A session may not stop in an undeclared (`active`) state; but we never block more than
# once, and never leak an undeclared stop:
#   declared (awaiting/blocked/error) ............... allow (the agent reported; nothing to do)
#   active, first stop  (stop_hook_active false) .... block ONCE — instruct the agent to declare
#   active, the continuation (stop_hook_active true)  do NOT block again -> auto-declare a safe default
#                                                     (awaiting, noted) and allow. Guaranteed to end.
# $SPEX is the PATH-independent CLI invocation (abs tsx + cli) injected by settingsArg, so the gate's
# own auto-default AND the command it shows the agent both work even when `spex` is absent from PATH.
# Runs with cwd = the session worktree; state is the deterministic, file-based .session.
