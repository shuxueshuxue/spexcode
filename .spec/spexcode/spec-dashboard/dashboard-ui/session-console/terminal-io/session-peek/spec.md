# session-peek

Embed the live session in the browser. tmux is client/server, so no attached
terminal is needed: read a pane with `capture-pane -p -e`, write with `send-keys`,
and xterm.js renders it. xterm grabs keyboard focus, so Escape is intercepted via
`term.attachCustomKeyEventHandler` → onClose — Esc exits the peek reliably.

The command line lives outside the terminal — a separate input element, not
xterm's stdin — so the arrow keys stay ours rather than being swallowed by the
terminal. While that input is empty the arrows fall through to navigation: ←/→
walk the spec tree to parent/child and ↑/↓ to siblings (see [[keyboard-nav]])
instead of editing text; once it holds text the arrows edit the line as usual.
