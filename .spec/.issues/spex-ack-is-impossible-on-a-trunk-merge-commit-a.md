concern: spex ack is impossible on a trunk merge commit: ack amends HEAD with the Spec-OK trailer, but by amend time MERGE_HEAD is gone, so the pre-commit main-guard rejects it as a direct trunk commit — the manager's documented post-merge drift remedy (merge with SKIP_LINT, then ack) cannot complete without SPEXCODE_ALLOW_MAIN=1, which docs reserve for seeding/topology. Either main-guard should recognize a pure trailer-stamp amend of the merge commit it just passed, or ack needs a non-amend path (e.g. empty commit with trailers, or stamping before the merge concludes).
