    description: >-
      Open the dashboard, press Enter to open the session console, then select the "View Session
      Relationship" tab — the network-glyph button paired with ＋ New Session, or press → from an
      empty New Session. Look: the right pane fills with the live monitor graph. Each live session
      is a node (avatar + name + status, ringed in its own hue), and any live `spex watch` A→B is a
      directed arrow in A's hue. Screenshot the rendered graph and file it with
      `spex yatsu eval session-graph --image <png> --pass`.
    expected: >-
      The relationship graph renders inside the console's right pane: every live session shows as a
      node and any live monitor shows as a directed arrow between two nodes. The filed reading carries
      the screenshot as image evidence and a pass verdict.
  - name: node-gestures
    description: >-
      In the relationship graph, exercise the pointer gestures. (1) DOUBLE-click a session node — the
      console switches to that session's tab (single-clicking does NOT open it). (2) Single LEFT-click
      a node — it lights up as the picked watcher (dashed hue outline) and a selection-bound hint appears
      prompting you to right-click the watched; that hint stays as long as the node is picked and disappears
      the instant the pick is cleared (click empty space). Then RIGHT-click a different node — an optimistic
      dashed monitor arrow appears from the first to the second with an "asked … to monitor …" toast, and no
      browser context menu pops up. Confirm there is NO standing gesture caption over the graph before any
      click — only the lone `?` help button — and that the click-then-right-click guidance appears reactively
      (the selection-bound pick hint, and the `?` legend). Screenshot the picked-source + pick-hint state and
      file it with `spex yatsu eval session-graph --image <png> --pass`.
    expected: >-
      Before any interaction the pane shows no permanent gesture caption (only the `?` button); the
      click-then-right-click rule is surfaced reactively. Double-click opens a session (single-click never
      does); a left-click picks a node as the watcher (visible highlight) and raises a selection-bound hint
      that persists while the node stays picked and vanishes the moment it is deselected; a following
      right-click on another node draws the optimistic pending monitor arrow and dispatches the ask — with
      the native context menu suppressed. There are no connection handles on the nodes. The filed reading
      carries the screenshot and a pass verdict.

# yatsu.md — session-graph

This view is product surface — it is measured by **looking** (YATU), not by a unit test: the agent opens
the relationship tab through the running console and screenshots the live monitor web (session nodes +
directed `spex watch` arrows), filing it as a reading with image evidence and a verdict.
