title: review-proof
hue: 150
desc: A fully-derived proof of work for a session in review — its yatsu evidence (measured loss), the diff, and the merge gates, rendered as one self-contained HTML on the fly when viewed. One backend engine; CLI, dashboard, and a bare browser are thin faces. No agent authoring.

# review-proof

## raw source

When a session is in the review state, a human deciding whether to merge shouldn't have to hand-read the
diff and hunt the evidence. Give them one **proof of work** — the session's measured yatsu evidence, its
diff, and the merge gates, in a single beautiful page. It is **fully DERIVED**: it costs the agent nothing
and can never go stale, because it is built from what the system already knows and **generated on the fly
each time it is opened**. This is the optimizer's measured loss, marshaled at the moment a human decides.

## expanded spec

**One engine, thin faces** (the [[yatsu-show]] / `buildBoard` pattern). The engine is `proof.ts` in
[[spec-yatsu]] — a proof IS the marshaled *evaluation*, so it lives with the evaluation package and is the
one place yatsu reaches into the review state ([[manager-cockpit]]'s `reviewPayload`). It runs ONLY on the
backend: `buildProofModel(id)` joins the payload's diff (grouped per spec node) with each changed node's
[[yatsu-eval-tab]] timeline (latest reading per scenario — verdict, expected, the content-addressed
evidence) and the gates; `renderProofHtml(model)` emits ONE self-contained HTML document, evidence inlined
as data-URIs ([[yatsu-core]]'s cache) so it stands alone as a plain file. The eval timelines are rooted at
the **session's worktree**, so freshness and readings reflect that branch, not the backend's checkout. The
headline is DERIVED (the node, else the branch) — there is no agent-authored claim, manifest, or narrative.
A frontend node with no yatsu.md shows as an honest blind spot, never hidden.

The faces are thin and all show the identical bytes. The backend serves `GET /api/sessions/:id/proof` (HTML;
`?format=json` = the model). `spex review proof <SEL>` is a backend CLIENT ([[remote-client]]) that fetches
that HTML and writes (`--out`) or opens (`--open`) it, so it works against a remote backend unchanged. The
dashboard ([[session-console]]) shows a **proof** action whenever the session is in the review state (a
standing merge/done proposal) that opens the same route in an overlay — natural support, still just the
artifact. Because the proof is derived, opening it always reflects the live diff/loss/gates.

Out of scope: the measurement engine and freshness ([[yatsu-core]]); the per-node eval tab
([[yatsu-eval-tab]]); the merge dispatch ([[manager-cockpit]]). This node only marshals what they already
produce into the review's proof — nothing is authored, only read.
