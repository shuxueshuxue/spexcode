desc: A session's display name is derived ONCE, server-side — the wire carries label (stable) + headline (live) and hides the bare name/title parts, so no surface can grow its own naming chain.

# session-label

## raw source

A session's name kept rendering wrong somewhere — the @-mention dropdown showed the bare launch-prompt
truncation (even a raw URL) while the list beside it showed the proper derived label. The derivation
existed, consistently, in FOUR places (backend sessionLabel/sessionHeadline, frontend twins), yet any new
surface could still reach for `s.title` and grow a fifth, wrong chain — and repeatedly did. The cure is
not another convention but an impossibility: make the bare parts unreachable, so future code CANNOT touch
the raw name and can only consume the derived one.

## expanded spec

**One computation site.** `toSession` is the single place display strings are derived: `label` — the
STABLE handle (name > node > title > branch > id; tables, selectors, tooltips, search) — and `headline` —
the LIVE line a human reads (name > activity > promptPreview > node > title > branch > id, activity gated
on liveness; see [[session-activity]]). Both ride every session on the wire; every surface — CLI tables,
watch/notify lines, the reply-channel footer, board rows, the @-mention dropdown, search — reads them.

**The bare parts don't ride the wire.** There is no top-level `title` or `name` on a session: the parts
live under `raw: { name, title }`, whose only sanctioned consumer is an explicitly raw surface (the rename
prefill must edit the override itself, [[session-rename]] — a derived value there would freeze as a fake
rename). Reaching for `s.raw.title` reads as deliberate in review; reaching for `s.title` returns
undefined and fails visibly. The wire-shape unit test is the executable half of this contract: it asserts
the derived fields exist, the precedences hold, and the bare fields are ABSENT — a future field
"helpfully" re-exposed fails the test before any surface can grow a bypass chain on it.

**The frontend has two doors and no windows.** `session.js`'s `sessionHandle`/`sessionHeadline` read the
wire fields; the legacy client-side chain survives only INSIDE those two functions as the old-backend
fallback, so during a mixed-version window labels degrade gracefully instead of blanking. Every component
imports the doors — none re-derives. The backend keeps `sessionLabel`/`sessionHeadline` as the same two
doors over the precomputed fields for its own display sites.

**The two doors are named for their ROLE, so the wrong one can't be grabbed by reflex.** The stable-handle
door is `sessionHandle`, deliberately NOT `sessionName`: a "name" reads like "the thing to display", and a
dev reaching for it by intuition kept wiring the stable label into a visible one-line title — the divergence
that recurred (the node-menu overlay list showed the label while the board beside it showed the live
headline). Renaming the door removes the trap at its source: `sessionHeadline` is now the only intuitively
"the name" door, so every human-visible one-line title lands on it, and `sessionHandle` is confined to its
three real jobs — the avatar/hover **tooltip**, mobile's handle-line, and search **matching** (search still
matches node/branch/id even where it shows the headline). Which surface reads which is [[session-activity]]'s
"one name, every surface"; naming the doors for their role is what makes that guarantee hold instead of
relying on every author to remember it.
