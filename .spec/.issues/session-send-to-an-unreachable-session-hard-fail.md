Reported by 60b8fda9's survey (bitten once): spex session send to a closed/unreachable session exits 2 and drops the message, while the forum's @-dispatch already has an offline -> drain-to-new-worker delivery. One delivery semantic should serve both surfaces; CLI send hard-failing is the odd one out.
