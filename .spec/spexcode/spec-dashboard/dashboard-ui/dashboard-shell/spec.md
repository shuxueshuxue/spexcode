# dashboard-shell

## raw source

The dashboard's feature nodes (node-graph, focus-panel, keyboard-nav, the session views…) all mount inside
one root component, poll through one data layer, and style against one global stylesheet. That substrate
has no single feature owner, so co-owning it fanned every shell/style edit across all of them. Give it a
foundation node; features REFERENCE what they touch via `related:` instead of co-owning it.

## expanded spec

dashboard-shell owns the cross-cutting dashboard files: `App.jsx` (the entry — it boots the one shared data
layer, owns the fail-loud boot below, and picks the face by viewport width), `Dashboard.jsx` (the desktop
root — it mounts the [[side-nav]] rail and swaps the routed page into the main area beside it, keeping the
warm pages — the graph, the session board — mounted across switches), `data.js` (the shared polled board
data every view reads), and `styles.css` (the global stylesheet). Route params that belong to a feature
(`#/issues/<id>`, `#/evals/<node>/<scenario>`) pass through this shell unchanged; the destination feature
owns their meaning. Likewise, feature-level shared widgets may add compact global style vocabulary here
when the rule is genuinely reused across shell surfaces. **Each face is its own lazy chunk**, and
the desktop root lazy-loads its heavy leaves (the session console with xterm, the evals/issues pages with
the annotator) the same way — so the phone face ([[mobile-ui]]) never downloads the graph or terminal
libraries, and the first graph paint doesn't wait on them either; the split moves bytes only, never
behaviour. The board **focus survives a reload or a mobile↔desktop breakpoint remount within its tab**
(session-scoped, so a fresh tab still opens on the root). A feature node lists whichever of these it touches under
`related:`, so editing the shell or the stylesheet attributes its drift/yatsu here rather than to every
feature (see [[governed-related]]). This is the dashboard twin of [[sessions-core]]: one owner for the
substrate, references everywhere else.

**One palette, two themes.** The whole app — the spec-node board, the react-flow canvas, AND the
session console — draws its colours from one set of CSS custom properties (`--paper --panel --panel2
--line --ink --ink2 --muted`, the accents `--blue/--green/--red/--yellow/--orange/--magenta/--cyan`,
`--term-bg`). Because every rule reads through those vars, a
theme is nothing but a second definition of them: `styles.css` keeps the solarized-light set as bare
`:root`, and redefines the full set under `:root[data-theme=dark]` as a modern GitHub-Dark neutral
near-black palette — so flipping the one `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` re-skins board and console
together, with no per-component theme logic. The embedded terminal stays dark in both themes (the
Claude TUI is dark-designed), so `--term-bg` is a neutral near-black in light *and* dark. Even the
**scrollbars** read through the palette: `styles.css` themes them globally (a thin, rounded thumb —
`--line` at rest, `--muted` on hover, over a transparent track) via `::-webkit-scrollbar*` for Blink/WebKit
and `scrollbar-color`/`scrollbar-width` for Firefox, so every scrollable pane matches the app in both
themes with no per-surface rule and no raw-OS default. The terminal is styled only at its edge; xterm keeps
its viewport geometry so scrollback and TUI wheel paths stay truthful.

`theme.js` owns the pick: `getTheme()` returns an explicit saved choice (`localStorage
spexcode.theme`) else the system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`), and `applyTheme(t)` sets the
`data-theme` attribute and persists — the same detect-then-defer-to-the-human shape as [[settings]]'s
language pick. To avoid a light-flash before the module boots, `index.html` runs a tiny inline script
in `<head>` that applies the same choice to `<html data-theme>` before first paint. The [[settings]]
page carries the live toggle.

**Fail-loud boot.** A board that never arrives (backend down, proxy dead) shows an **error + retry panel**,
never an eternal spinner — the pre-first-board window is the only reader; once a board has landed, a failed
refetch keeps the last good board and the stream/poll below keep retrying on their own.

**Push-first board — freshest-issued wins.** The shell keeps the board fresh through three paths. The
primary is the **delta subscription** ([[board-stream]]/[[board-delta]]): whole boards arrive over the push
channel — a full on connect, then patches the data layer applies to its unit-map mirror — straight into
state, no refetch per change; a patch whose chain tag mismatches reopens the stream and re-anchors on the
fresh full. Second, an **on-demand** `reload()` (`/api/board`): a session close/rename calls it so every
surface reflects the change at once, and an old backend that only speaks bare `board-changed` downgrades the
subscription to exactly this refetch path. Third, a **slow fallback poll that always runs**. The shell deliberately keeps NO push-liveness detector: a
silently dead stream (a half-open tunnel, a sleep-resume, a network switch) delivers no data and no error
event, so it is indistinguishable from a healthy quiet one — a poll that stands down behind "push is proven
alive" freezes the board in exactly those modes. Instead the poll's cost is zeroed by conditional requests:
`loadBoard` remembers the board's ETag and sends `If-None-Match`, an unchanged board answers a bodyless 304
and the shell skips the repaint — so an untouched board costs headers only, yet no failure mode (silently
dead SSE, SSE-stripping proxy, old backend) is ever staler than the poll period. Because pushed boards and in-flight fetches can
interleave, the shell stamps every application with a monotonic sequence — a pushed board is freshest by
channel order, so it bumps the sequence and invalidates any older fetch still in flight; a superseded
response is dropped, never painted. Without that guard a just-closed session resurrects: the post-close
reload paints the row gone, then a stale in-flight snapshot lands late and flickers it back. The guard makes
a removal stick the moment its own reload lands.
