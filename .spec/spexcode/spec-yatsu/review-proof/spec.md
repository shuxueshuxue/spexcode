title: review-proof
hue: 150
desc: A session's fully-derived evaluation — the console's Eval tab (the shared eval components, session-scoped, tiered loading) over the same worktree-rooted engine that renders the self-contained proof HTML as an EXPORT artifact. No agent authoring.

# review-proof

## raw source

A human deciding whether to merge — or just wanting to see what a session has done so far — shouldn't have to
hand-read the diff and hunt the evidence. Give them one **proof of work** — the session's measured yatsu
evidence, its diff, and the merge gates, in a single beautiful page, available for **any** session (it comes
into its own at review, but the human can open it any time). It is **fully DERIVED**: it costs the agent nothing
and can never go stale, because it is built from what the system already knows and **generated on the fly
each time it is opened**. This is the optimizer's measured loss, marshaled at the moment a human decides.

## expanded spec

**One engine, thin faces** (the [[yatsu-show]] / `buildBoard` pattern). The engine is `proof.ts` in
[[spec-yatsu]] — a proof IS the marshaled *evaluation*, so it lives with the evaluation package and is the
one place yatsu reaches into the review state ([[manager-cockpit]]'s `reviewPayload`). It runs ONLY on the
backend: `buildProofModel(id)` joins the payload's diff (grouped per spec node) with each changed node's
[[yatsu-eval-tab]] timeline (latest reading per scenario — verdict, expected, the content-addressed
evidence) and the gates; `renderProofHtml(model)` emits ONE self-contained HTML document, evidence inlined
as data-URIs ([[yatsu-core]]'s cache) so it stands alone as a plain file. The eval timelines are rooted at
the **session's worktree**, so freshness and readings reflect that branch, not the backend's checkout. The
headline is DERIVED (the node, else the branch) — there is no agent-authored claim, manifest, or narrative.
A frontend node with no yatsu.md shows as an honest blind spot, never hidden.

Every changed file — `spec.md` included — is a **drill-down**: its row expands to the unified diff
(base..HEAD), and further to the full original ↔ new content side by side, all derived from git and inlined
behind native toggles (capped so a huge changeset can't bloat the page). Nothing is hidden — the whole
diff and both file versions are there to jump into, no extra fetch.

**The faces split by purpose — the interactive face is the eval component family, the artifact is the
export.** The dashboard's face is the console right pane's **Eval tab** (Terminal / Eval; the typed
`/eval` board command switches to it): the THIRD scope of the ONE eval component family — the node
popup reads one node, the issues page reads the project, this tab reads *this session* — the same rows, the same
[[event-detail]] detail, master-detail like the issues page. It fetches the LEAN model (`GET
/api/sessions/:id/evals` — rows only, worktree-rooted, no diff enrichment, no inlined bytes) and rides the
tiered loading every eval face shares: collapsed scenario rows first, evidence streamed from
`/api/yatsu/blob` only when a row opens. Rows order by attention: **blind spots lead** (declared, never
measured — the outstanding loss), then the latest reading per scenario — the CURRENT score of what the
session changed — with the session's own measurements first and ✦-marked (a reading is the session's own
iff its `codeSha` is one of the branch's commits — derived, never tagged); a count chip narrows the list
to only those when the reviewer wants the session's evidence alone. A gates strip (the same
`reviewPayload` numbers `spex review` prints — lint memoized on the checkout fingerprint,
[[manager-cockpit]]) sits above; there is NO build/typecheck/test gate, because soundness is proven by
measuring the real product, not by a language-specific checker. When the session has no worktree/diff the
tab shows a clean empty placeholder.

The **self-contained HTML** (`renderProofHtml`: evidence inlined as data-URIs, every changed file's
diff + before/after drill-down) remains as the **export artifact** — CI attachments, sharing, a bare
browser — behind the tab's `export ↗` link (labelled as the export it is, tooltip naming the self-contained
HTML report), `GET /api/sessions/:id/proof` (`?format=json` = the model), and
`spex review proof <SEL>` (`--out`/`--open`, a backend client that works against a remote backend
unchanged). Inlining everything is the right shape for a file that must stand alone, and the wrong shape
for an interactive tab — that is the whole split.
