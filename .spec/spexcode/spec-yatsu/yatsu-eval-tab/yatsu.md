      Open the dashboard, focus a node that declares scenarios but has none measured yet (a yatsu.md
      with no readings — or use a route fixture that sets a node's `evals` to []), and open its eval
      tab (key `4`). The tab must NOT dead-end at a bare "no measurements yet" line: under that hint it
      lists each DECLARED scenario as a blind-spot row — an empty score ring, the scenario name, the
      files it tracks, and its `expected`. For a node where some scenarios are measured and others not,
      the unmeasured ones LEAD the one reading timeline as the same kind of blind-spot row (no fenced-off
      band, no second scrollbar — the empty ring is the only distinction). Screenshot the popup's eval tab and file with
      `spex yatsu eval yatsu-eval-tab --scenario declared-scenarios-visible-without-readings --image <png> --pass`.
    expected: >-
      The eval tab surfaces the WHOLE declared set, not only the readings: a scenario with no reading
      shows its name + expected (+ tracked files) under a blind-spot ring, so a node's measurable intent
      is legible inside the popup even before any reading lands — the only place it shows once the popup
      covers the focus panel. No reading at all → the declared list under a hint; some measured, some not
      → those same rows lead the one timeline (the empty ring is the only distinction, not a separate band).

# yatsu.md — yatsu-eval-tab

Product surface, measured by **looking** (YATU): the agent opens the dashboard, opens a node's eval tab in
the two states that have no reading to expand (none measured, and some-but-not-all measured), and
screenshots that the DECLARED scenarios are visible — name, expected, tracked files, blind-spot ring — not
only a hint to go measure them. The scenario scopes its freshness `code:` to the eval tab's own component
(`NodeView.jsx`) and its stylesheet slice — the [[yatsu-eval-tab]] read engine in `evaltab.ts` already
ships the declared set on the board, so this measures only the surface that renders it.
