Reverse-engineer a spec tree for the target source area(s) below — or **re-run to reconcile** an
already-extracted area, the same pass that closes the gaps code growth opens (an unclaimed governed file, a
frontend node missing its loss signal, a thin scenario). Extraction is not a one-shot. Aim for a tree where
every governed file is claimed and `spex spec lint` is clean, bodies at contract altitude and in the codebase's
own primary language (a predominantly-Chinese repo → Chinese specs).

{{targets}}

**Find the spine the code already declares first** — a barrel of exports, a README or design doc, the
dependency direction between modules — and adopt it as the top-level shape, refined where the code reveals
finer responsibilities. Only when the code declares no architecture is the top-level cut a judgment call
worth raising with the human.

Then grow nodes under that spine:

- **Decompose by responsibility, not by file.** A node is one job the code does. A fat file split across
  several jobs becomes several nodes that each claim it; one job spanning several files becomes one node
  claiming them all. Every governed file is claimed by at least one node; nest into subtrees where warranted.
- **Group wide layers; don't mirror the file tree — at every level, the root included.** One-node-per-folder
  is a smell. If a node would have more than ~7 direct children you're under-grouping: add intermediate
  **sub-domain** nodes that cluster siblings serving one concern (model-config + selection + auth → a *model*
  domain), and recurse until every level reads as a handful of siblings, not a flat wall. Fold cross-cutting
  substrate (design system, i18n, platform glue) under one *foundation* node that claims the cluster's
  barrel/wiring files (so it isn't pure-prose); split a fat folder holding several distinct jobs. Group by
  responsibility, never to hit a number.
- **Stay at contract altitude.** State each node's intent, invariants, and outward behavior — what it
  guarantees and why — not how the code does it.
- **Never fabricate intent.** Code shows *what it does*, rarely *why*. Read any README/design docs for real
  intent; where you can still only see behavior, state the behavior and mark the intent as inferred rather
  than inventing a rationale.
- **Reserve pure-prose nodes** (no `code:`) for a genuine cross-cutting contract no single file owns. Use
  sparingly.
- **Mind the scope boundary.** A file that looks like a thin wrapper may be the foot of a feature defined
  outside the target area — flag it instead of mis-homing it, and prefer extracting the whole repo so
  cross-cutting features stay visible. If nothing reaches a file, say it's likely dead rather than
  dignifying it with a confident spec.

**Give every frontend node a loss signal.** A node that governs UI or visual code (`.tsx`/`.jsx`/`.vue`/
`.svelte`/`.css`, or the dashboard) is a blind spot until it carries a `eval.md` — so write one as you
extract it: a **real user-path** scenario — a goal and the steps to reach it through the running app (never a
bare render-check), covering a failure/empty/edge state — with a **description** of those steps, the
**expected** zero-loss result, and **≥1 `tags`** classifying it (a surface like `frontend-e2e`/`backend-api`/
`cli`, a device like `desktop`/`mobile`) drawn from the configured library (`lint.scenarioTags`); a tag
outside the library fails `scan`, so use an existing one or extend the library. Frontend scenarios are measured by looking (YATU) — a screenshot filed with
`spex eval add <node> --image <png> --pass`. Backend nodes don't need one yet; run `spex eval lint` to
list the frontend nodes still uncovered. On a **re-run** this is also where you sharpen — give an uncovered
node its first scenario, tighten a thin one (a bare render-check, or a stale `expected`); `spex guide eval`
has the schema.

**Extract incrementally — don't plan the whole tree before writing.** For a large area (hundreds of files),
enumerating the whole partition up front or scripting a generator to emit it at once burns context before a
node lands and loses everything to one interruption. Fix the top-level cut and commit it, then take ONE
subtree at a time (write the leaf, list its files, lint, COMMIT) before the next — never more than one
subtree uncommitted, so progress survives context limits.

Confirm `spexcode.json`'s `governedRoots` points at the real source dirs first — lint reads silently empty
otherwise. Commit one node per commit (`spec: <id> — extract from <area>`) and run `spex spec lint` after each:
0 errors, 0 coverage/altitude warnings.
