# eval-core

## raw source

The scoreboard slice of [[spec-eval]]: the eval/loss engine that KEEPS SCORE of a node's behaviour and
EXECUTES NOTHING. A spec carries how to measure its loss; the agent measures; eval records the result and
flags it stale. Prove the whole loop — declare a scenario, file a measurement, detect when it goes stale,
prune the evidence — works end to end through the real `spex` surface, with no browser and no executor.

## expanded spec

A node declares its scenarios in a **eval.md** beside its spec.md (a frontmatter `scenarios:` list, each a
**name** + **description** + **expected** zero-loss result + **tags**, plus OPTIONAL **test** (either a
co-located runnable-file path or strict `{ path, name }`, where `name` is an opaque concrete case inside
that file), **code** (the file this scenario GOVERNS, ideally one) and **related** (files it
references but does not own — they never stale it). A eval.md owns nothing; only its scenarios govern and
relate — the [[governed-related]] model on the scenario axis. A scenario is a *target the agent measures
however it likes*, not a script eval runs. Both test forms validate that `path` exists; the object key set
is closed and `name` is preserved exactly, never parsed as WDIO, Playwright, or any other framework syntax.
There is no executor or framework adapter here. The first four fields are required and the scenario key set
is closed; a **strict validator** rejects a malformed eval.md LOUD — at `scan` and the pre-commit gate, never
silently reshaped. Every read surface carries the normalized test reference through scan, graph, and scenario
list JSON so callers see one stable shape regardless of how the author wrote the path-only shorthand.

**Tags classify a scenario** so it can be filtered now and routed to the right driver later (a surface like
`frontend-e2e`/`backend-api`/`cli`, a device like `desktop`/`mobile`). Each scenario carries **≥1 tag**, every
tag drawn from a **closed vocabulary** — the library configured in `lint.scenarioTags` (spexcode.json). A tag
outside the library is rejected with the repair the author owns: pick an existing tag, or **extend the
library** to mint a new one. The library is data, not a fixed enum baked in code, so the project grows its
own classification deliberately; the tags ride into `/api/graph` so every surface that shows a scenario
(the search palette and [[eval-tab]]) renders them as a uniform chip.

A scenario is the unit of measurement, so its **freshness is its own**: its optional `code` subset is its
code freshness axis (a `code`/`related` path that doesn't exist is flagged, never silently immortal); absent,
it inherits the node's whole `code:` list. So two scenarios on one node, tracking different files, go stale
independently — one node's loss is many signals, not one. A file governed by more scenarios than `maxOwners`
is the `eval-owners` smell (split it). Measurements live apart in a flat
**evals.ndjson** sidecar — **append-only, one JSON line per EVENT**. A filing appends a *reading*
(scenario, codeSha, the **`scenarioHash`** contract stamp (see freshness below), an **evidence LIST** (each entry
a typed `{hash, kind ∈ image|video|transcript|data}` — the render taxonomy ([[evidence-kind-taxonomy]])),
the video entry's optional timelineBlob ([[step-timeline]]),
an optional **`by`** (the SESSION that filed
it, from envSessionId), **verdict**, ts) — the second git-as-database axis: a reading commit is a *measurement
event*, not a spec version, so history and attribution apply unchanged. `by` is the reachable session behind the
filing — the ORIGINATOR an eval-comment thread loops in on a reply ([[mentions]]). It is purely additive: a
legacy reading without it simply has no originator, so the loop-in stays silent; a human filing through the
HTTP route has no reachable session and omits it too. WHO measured is deliberately NOT a schema axis: the
agent is the measuring hand, and the retired per-reading `evaluator` tag (constant `manual@1` on every
reading ever filed) carried zero signal — legacy lines still hold the key, read-tolerated like the scalar
`blob`, rendered if present, never written again.

The sanctioned undo appends a **retraction** — `{retracts: <target reading's ts>, scenario, note?, by?, ts}`
— never deletes or rewrites a line, so a botched filing (a junk e2e/smoke run, a wrong verdict) is reversible
*through the same surface that wrote it* while the trace stays: the target line remains as history, the
retraction event says who withdrew it and why, and git carries both. Every score consumer reads the
**effective view** (readings minus the retracted, joined by (scenario, ts)) through one seam
(`readReadings`), so a retract undoes the filing on freshness, scan, clean's referenced-blob set, the eval
tab, and the proof at once — the previous reading becomes the latest again, or the scenario honestly returns
to `eval-missing`; a retracted reading's blobs simply fall out of the referenced set at the next clean. The
two event kinds are told apart **positively** — a retraction carries `retracts`, a reading carries `codeSha`;
neither is ever recognized by another field's *absence* — and a
retraction matching no reading is inert. The trace stays navigable: the timeline carries the retraction
events beside the effective readings, and `show` renders each as a `⟲ retracted` line.

The **verdict** is the loss against `expected`: `pass` or `fail`. Either may carry an optional **note** — a
one-line annotation (why it failed, how far a pass sits from ideal). A note is an annotation *on* the verdict,
not a third status: a measurement must commit to pass or fail, and a scenario you haven't actually measured is
`eval-missing`, never a hedged note-as-verdict. The **evidence** is a **LIST** of content-addressed entries —
N `image`s and/or a `video` (with its step-timeline) and/or a `transcript` and/or a `data` block ([[evidence-kind-taxonomy]]), each typed by its `kind` (the
captured actual behaviour — the *why* lives there, the note only summarises it). One filing can carry a whole
run: several stills beside the recorded clip. Backward-compatible: a legacy **scalar** reading (one `blob` +
`blobKind`) reads as a one-entry list, so old readings still render; one filed before verdicts existed — or a
legacy note-only reading — renders as *legacy*.

**Freshness is derived at read time, never stored as a verdict.** A reading goes stale on three axes —
the CODE axis (git-derived: a governed `code:` file changed since its codeSha), the SCENARIO axis (its
own measurement contract moved), plus a **non-git** axis, the REMARK ([[remark-teeth]]): an unresolved
remark on the scenario ages it like a drift event, and a resolved one keeps it stale until a reading
taken *after* the resolve exists.

The scenario axis is **per-scenario, semantic, and decided by a stored contract hash**. Because a
scenario is the unit of measurement, a reading stales only when ITS OWN measurement contract moved — the
**semantic fields, description + expected** (what to measure, what zero loss looks like) — never when a
*sibling* scenario sharing the same eval.md did, never on a sidecar-only commit, never on a merge's
textual reshuffle, and never on a **metadata-only edit**: tags (routing — which surface/hand measures)
and the file pointers test/code/related change nothing about what an already-taken reading proved. Each
filing stamps the reading with **`scenarioHash`** — the content hash of the semantic projection of the
scenario declaration it measured — and freshness is then a **pure text compare**: the stored hash against
the hash of the scenario's CURRENT declaration. Equal → fresh; different → stale; scenario gone from
eval.md → stale (nothing current answers for it; a renamed scenario is not an edit but a remove+add — a
new key, honestly unmeasured). The hash definition is deterministic and normative: each of description
and expected independently **collapses every whitespace run (space, tab, CR, LF) to a single space and
trims its ends** — so a prose re-wrap, an indent shift, CRLF churn, a literal-vs-folded block-scalar
restyle never move it — then the two normalized fields join with a single `\n` (unambiguous: neither can
contain one after normalization) and the UTF-8 bytes are sha256-hexed (`scenarios.ts scenarioHash`, the
one definition both filing seams and freshness read). The hash is pure text over the parsed declaration —
no git walk, no file position, no history — so it is identical in every checkout, on any branch shape,
however the same contract text got there. That is what makes fleet-parallel measurement **converge**:
agents filing readings and merging waves cannot re-stale each other's readings unless a contract's text
actually changed (issue #61 — the previous, git-derived axis keyed change-commits off a linearized
whole-history walk, and a DAG flattened to a list cross-attributes parallel branches' edits to one
eval.md, so every merge re-flagged the other branch's readings and the stale count never reached zero).
A text round-trip (edit away, edit back) reads fresh by design — the contract measured and the contract
now are the same text. The deliberate tradeoff carried over from the projection: a wrong→right retag
means an old reading may have been measured through the wrong modality and still reads fresh — accepted
because the reading's **evidence kind** (image/video/transcript/data) already records how it was ACTUALLY
measured, so the mismatch stays visible to a human and to review.

**Legacy readings degrade to the git-derived rule, one-shot and exclusive.** A reading filed before the
hash existed carries none, and for it the retained per-scenario git axis decides (`scenariofresh.ts`):
per scenario NAME, the commits where that block's semantic projection (the same description+expected,
block-scalar-folded) changed, rename-followed — the walk is **whole-history**, never
first-parent-simplified (a block edit that landed on a node branch and merged in still counts), and its
pathspec names BOTH spellings of the scenario file — the live `*eval.md` AND the retired `*yatsu.md` —
because it reads **immutable history, and an archive answers only to its archive name**: pre-rename
commits touched files literally named yatsu.md, so a single live-name pathspec would truncate every chain
at the rename commit and spray false stale across every pre-rename reading (the adopter corpora this
protects are real — hundreds of readings; the rename commit itself is a pure `git mv`, R100, and stales
nothing). Exactly ONE track decides each reading: hash present → the hash compare alone; hash absent →
the git rule alone — never both OR-ed into a double jeopardy, and no third fallback behind either. The
degradation is honest (the old rule's #61 over-staling persists for old readings) and self-retiring: the
next filing of that scenario carries the hash and leaves the legacy track for good.

Both the code axis and the legacy scenario track judge "changed since" by TRUE ancestry
([[drift-by-ancestry]]) — a commit stales the reading iff it is *not an ancestor* of its codeSha. An
**off-history codeSha** — orphaned by a fold, rebase, squash-merge or cherry-pick, or sitting on a
never-merged branch — is where ancestry stops testifying, but the trees still do: while the anchor commit
object exists locally, freshness **falls back to content** — the anchor's tree diffed against HEAD,
scoped to the reading's governed files on the code axis and to that ONE scenario's semantic projection on
the legacy scenario track. Byte-identical content reads fresh; a real difference stales exactly the moved
axis. Only when the anchor commit object is truly gone (pruned) does the conservative stale remain,
surfaced as its own **anchor** axis so "anchor lost" never masquerades as "content changed" — and a
hash-bearing reading's scenario axis still testifies even then, because the stored hash needs no anchor.
The fallback is fed to the pure decision functions at the call sites (a content probe, exactly like the
remark track) and the in-history fast path pays no extra git call. An ack vindicates a *spec*, not a
reading. `freshness.ts` stays a pure computation — the remark track is fed in at the call sites, never
read from the issue store here.

The code axis also **reports its drift for display**, not just decides it: `codeDrift` counts, per governed
file, how many commits in `codeSha..HEAD` touched it (the same ancestry reachability, reused — not a second
freshness path), so a surface can say `EvalsFeed.jsx +3` instead of a bare "code moved" ([[event-detail]]'s
stale readout). It is derived, never stored, and never feeds the stale/fresh decision — it explains one.

The surface mirrors the code-drift report:
- **lint [--changed]** — the measurement layer's findings, PURE ADVISORY and always exit 0 (`spex spec
  lint`'s errors block commits; a measurement gap never blocks anyone — one lint per layer, same word):
  a malformed eval.md (`eval-schema` — missing field,
  unknown key, dup name, ghost `code`/`related` path, out-of-library tag), a stale reading (`eval-drift`), a scenario never
  measured (`eval-missing`), a node governing **source code** with **no eval.md** (`eval-coverage` — the same
  NAME and shape as [[spec-lint]]'s coverage, keyed off
  the SAME configurable `sourceExtensions` knob, so a backend/CLI/Rust/Go/Python
  project's own sources are held to the loss discipline too, not just web files; no second web-only allowlist),
  an orphaned remark track (`eval-dangling`), and a whole-repo
  summary — a file governed by > `maxOwners` scenarios (`eval-owners`, split it). A `drift`/`missing` line
  carries the scenario's **tags**, so a reader (and [[eval-proactive]]'s Stop nudge) sees the gap's SURFACE —
  e.g. a browser-measured `frontend-e2e` scenario needs a real product run to refresh, not a desk check.
  `--changed` scopes the per-node classes to the nodes the branch touched ([[eval-proactive]]); plain lint covers the repo.
- **scenario ls [<node>|.] [--unmeasured] [--json]** — the DECLARED half of the scoreboard: the measurement
  contracts (name · tags · normalized test reference · latest verdict), no readings. Bare lists every measurable node's scenarios;
  `--unmeasured` keeps only those with no effective reading — never measured, or every filing retracted —
  the blind-spot worklist a measuring hand picks from.
- **add [.|<node>] [--scenario N] (--pass|--fail|--note T) [--image P …repeatable] [--result P|-] [--video P [--timeline P]]** —
  FILE the measurement the agent already took. eval runs nothing: it stores the evidence under one verdict,
  for one scenario. `--image` REPEATS (N stills) and combines freely with `--result`/`--video` in one filing —
  each is pushed onto the reading's evidence list; `--timeline` anchors the video entry. add's flag set is
  **closed**, the argv mirror of the scenario schema's closed field set: an unrecognized `--flag` is rejected
  LOUD (before any node lookup or filing), never silently ignored — a version-skewed CLI that didn't know
  `--video` once filed the clip as an `--image`, and a misfiled reading is worse than none (it reads as evidence).
  A reading anchors to `codeSha` — and a sha can only name a COMMIT, never a working tree — so **the only
  honest reading is measured on a CLEAN tree**, where HEAD *is* the code measured. Filed over uncommitted
  governed edits, a reading is **mis-anchored at birth**: it claims a verdict at HEAD while HEAD lacks the
  edits actually measured — a pass for code that never ran — and the stale flag after the next commit is
  freshness correctly exposing that lie, not an engine bug. add therefore probes the scenario's governed
  files (its `code` subset, else the node's list, plus its own eval.md) for uncommitted changes and warns
  LOUD when it finds any — a warning, never a block (the filing proceeds; retract is the repair). The
  discipline it teaches is NOT "commit before you test" — gaining confidence and archiving sha-anchored
  evidence are two different acts. ① **Measure on the working tree** (dirty, with the fix), re-measure until
  green: the informal confidence gate, before any commit. ② **Commit that just-tested tree as-is** — what
  lands is code already verified, so no blind commit and no revert-as-routine — and now the tree is clean:
  HEAD *is* the code measured. ③ **Only then file the reading**: codeSha=HEAD names committed, verified
  code, the guard stays silent, and the eval sidecar appends as the last layer of evidence. The sha anchor
  can only land after the commit; the confidence must land before it. The seam has a **write half over data** too (filing.ts): a caller with a
  verdict but no argv — the HTTP eval-write route (`POST /api/specs/:id/evals`, the REST pair of the GET), a
  programmatic filer — appends through the SAME seam. Filing is the CLI/agent surface: [[event-detail]] reads
  readings and hosts remarks, it files nothing.
- **retract [.|<node>] [--scenario N] [--last | --ts <iso>] [--note <why>]** — the sanctioned inverse of
  add: withdraw a botched filing by APPENDING a retraction event (see above), never by deleting its line.
  Node and scenario resolve exactly as add resolves them; the default target is the scenario's latest
  effective reading (`--last` makes that explicit — repeated retracts peel a junk run back one filing at a
  time), `--ts` pins an exact one. A retract that finds nothing to withdraw — no reading, an unknown ts, an
  already-retracted target — fails LOUD; its flag set is closed like add's.
- **clean [--keep-latest|--all]** — GC the evidence cache (blobs no reading references, by default).

There is **no executor seam and no per-reading instrument schema**: a measuring hand (human or future
computer-use) is never code eval calls, and it earns a schema field only when a second kind of hand
actually exists — attribution today is the `by` session plus the commit trailer, nothing else.

**A measurable node's id IS its canonical spec id** — minted by the same rule, over the same universe, as the
spec loader ([[id-url-safe]]'s exported mint: the leaf dir name, or on a leaf collision the shortest
globally-unique `_`-joined trailing suffix, computed over ALL spec nodes, not just the measurable subset). There
is no second, eval-local id scheme: the id `add`/`ls`/`retract` answer to is exactly the id the board,
lint and search already print, so a reading always lands on the node every other surface means by that id.
A node ref resolves LOUD: an exact canonical id always wins; a bare leaf name stays the convenience it
always was while it names exactly one measurable node; a leaf several nodes share is an error listing the
candidate canonical ids — never an arbitrary first hit in walk order.

Evidence is content-addressed under the **shared git common dir** ([[portable-layout]]) — one copy per repo,
outside the tree, uncommittable (no .gitignore). A gone blob renders as `miss original file`; a pre-commit
backstop rejects a stray blob or a malformed eval.md. `spec-cli/src/cli.ts` carries only a thin
`eval` drawer route ([[forge-cli]] shape) — eval-core's sole stake in that shared hub.

Out of scope (sibling nodes): the dashboard eval-tab read side and the forge `needs-eval` half of
lint. Computer-use and backend measurement are future measuring hands, not code paths here.
