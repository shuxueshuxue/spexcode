# source-of-truth

The canonical spec state is `.spec` on `main`. A worktree's `.spec` is never a
rival truth — it is a pending proposal, attributed to a session. On merge it
becomes the new version plus one entry in that node's history. The dashboard is a
read-time aggregator over git, not a separate store.
