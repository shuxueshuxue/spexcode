scenarios:
  - name: parse-and-resolve
    tags: [cli]
    code: spec-cli/src/mentions.ts
    description: >-
      Call parseMentions on text mixing `@actor`, `@new`, repeated actors, and `[[node]]` refs. Then
      resolveActors on the actor tokens against a session set containing an ONLINE session and an OFFLINE one.
    expected: >-
      parseMentions returns actors and nodes each deduped in first-seen order (`@` at word boundaries only,
      `[[id]]` for nodes). resolveActors maps `new`→a `new` sentinel, a token matching an ONLINE session→that
      session (by id / id-prefix / name-or-title), and a token matching only an OFFLINE session OR nothing→
      `unresolved` — a dead session is never summoned.
  - name: landed-thread-guard
    tags: [cli]
    code: spec-cli/src/mentions.ts
    description: >-
      Build the @new worker prompt (newWorkerPrompt) and the dispatch summary for a thread whose status is
      non-open (landed/accepted/rejected), and again for an open/unknown-status thread.
    expected: >-
      Settled thread: the prompt leads with the resolved status and a verify-on-main-first /
      reply-instead-of-re-implementing instruction, and the outcome line carries the ⚠ thread-<status>
      warning. Open or unknown status: no note, no warning — the guard never fires on live work or on a
      forge reply whose state is unknown at write time.
  - name: issue-dispatch-wiring
    tags: [cli]
    code: spec-cli/src/mentions.ts
    related: [spec-cli/src/localIssues.ts]
    description: >-
      Through the real CLI, post an issue reply/thread whose body `@`-mentions an actor and also writes a
      `[[node]]` ref, in a repo with no live sessions.
    expected: >-
      The post is committed regardless (storage and delivery are separate); dispatch is best-effort and LOUD —
      an unresolved/offline actor is reported ("no live session; stored"), never failing the committed post;
      the `[[node]]` ref is passive (parsed, never dispatched). Live delivery (sendKeys to an online session,
      `@new` spawning a worker) reuses [[dispatch]]/[[launch]] and is measured on a real backend deployment.
  - name: spawn-parent-lineage
    tags: [cli]
    code: spec-cli/src/mentions.ts
    description: >-
      In an isolated store (SPEXCODE_HOME + SPEXCODE_TMUX + SPEXCODE_CLAUDE_CMD pointed at an inert command),
      seed one governed session record, then through the real CLI post `spex issues open … --body "@new …"`
      twice: once authored BY that session (SPEXCODE_SESSION_ID = its id), once authored by a non-session
      identity (`human`/`unknown`/a forge login). Read each spawned worker's session.json `parent` field.
    expected: >-
      The spawn's parent = its originator: when the mentioning author is a real board session id, the spawned
      worker's record carries it as `parent` (so the dashboard folds the worker under the session that
      summoned it, [[session-nesting]]); an author that is NOT a session — human, unknown, a forge login —
      yields an empty parent, a top-level worker, never a phantom nest.
  - name: cli-sigil-tolerance
    tags: [cli]
    code: spec-cli/src/mentions.ts
    related: [spec-cli/src/sessions.ts, spec-yatsu/src/cli.ts]
    description: >-
      Through the real CLI, name the same referent with and without its sigil: a session selector as
      `<sel>`, `@<sel>`, and `[[<sel>]]` (a list verb like `spex ls` AND a control verb through the
      single-target resolver), and a node arg as `<node>` and `[[<node>]]` (`spex yatsu show`/`eval`).
    expected: >-
      Identical output for every pair — a sigiled CLI argument resolves to exactly what the bare token
      resolves to, never widening a match (a wrong sigiled token errors the same as the bare one). Sigils
      stay REQUIRED in free text; the tolerance is CLI-argument-only.

# measuring mentions

YATU through the real `mentions` module and the real `spex issues`/`note` CLI. The pure grammar (parse +
resolve) is measured directly on the exported functions; the wiring is measured by posting to the issue store and
reading the loud dispatch summary. The one part that needs a running backend + live sessions — an actual
`sendKeys` delivery and an `@new` spawn — is deferred to a real-deployment measurement, not faked here.
