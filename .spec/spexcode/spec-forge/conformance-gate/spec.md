# conformance-gate

A **pending** design contract — the scope, not the implementation. It marries the two halves the tree
already carries: [[ci-gate]] (the non-bypassable CI backstop running `spex lint` + `tsc`) and
[[spec-forge]] (the read-only forge tracer that resolves an issue/PR to the node it serves). The gap
between them is the whole node:

**Not a standalone feature — one direction of the [[deliver-port]] framework.** An external PR arrives
as a [[session-origin]] `pr`-origin session defaulting to `destination: verdict`; delivering that verdict
(a Check + a sticky comment) is what this subtree builds. The cluster is the deliver port's **verdict
driver** (plus the **forge driver**'s write verbs it stands on) — the *inward* half (external PR →
reviewed → accepted or rejected), mirror of the outward half (our own session → a PR). When a maintainer
accepts, the same session simply retargets to `destination: trunk` — no separate merge path.

> take the **[[session-eval]]** derived-evidence model — today fed only by an internal session's worktree —
> generalize its root to **any PR branch**, add an **agentic conformance verdict** on top, and write that
> verdict **back to the forge's execution plane** (a Check + a sticky comment).

This is the LLM judge [[spec-lint]] explicitly deferred: lint keeps the spec↔code *graph* honest in the
commit path; whether the code still honors what the spec *says* is judged here, async, on the forge.

## the pipeline this parent scopes — determinism first, agency only where meaning must be judged

A forge event (PR opened/synchronized) runs `spex forge gate <PR>` in CI. Four layers:

- **Tier 0 — deterministic, blocking.** Reuse [[ci-gate]]/[[manager-cockpit]]'s gates: `spex lint` errors
  + `tsc --noEmit` + `conflictsWithMain`. Red here fails before any agent runs — cheap, no LLM.
- **Tier 0.5 — deterministic, signal.** The **spec-touch matrix**: route each merge-base-diff file to its
  node via the `code:` graph, classify `(spec touched?, code touched?)` per node. The load-bearing cell is
  *code changed / spec untouched* — the silent divergence the dogfood forbids.
- **Tier 1 — agentic, the verdict.** One judge per touched node, structured output. Owned by
  [[conformance-judge]].
- **Tier 2 — agentic, optional (default off).** On `diverges`/`spec-missing`, propose the spec edit or
  missing eval scenario as a forge **suggestion** — never an auto-push or auto-merge.

## the load-bearing decision — writing back does NOT break the read-only contract

[[spec-forge]]'s rule is "never write a node's **git-derived status/version**". A Check Run and a PR comment
are the forge's **execution plane**, not the spec graph. The verdict never sets a node's version or status;
a merge still flows back only through git. So the write-seam is a *new capability axis*, not a violation —
definition (the graph) and execution (the forge) stay un-crossed, exactly as the [[port]] requires.

## the decomposition — what each child owns

- **[[forge-write-seam]]** — the forge driver's write verbs the read-only [[port]] lacks (open/update a
  PR; post a Check; upsert a sticky comment), behind the same host-agnostic seam — what both the outward
  (session → PR) and inward (Check + comment) deliveries go through.
- **[[conformance-judge]]** — the verdict driver's core: the per-node agentic intent verdict (Tier 1) and
  its deterministic Tier-0.5 spec-touch input.
- **[[forge-gate]]** — the orchestration: `spex forge gate <PR>` + the CI workflow that runs it; also the
  one change generalizing the [[session-eval]] evidence root from a session worktree to any PR ref.
- **[[dashboard-prs]]** — the dashboard surface: PR badge, review lane, PR proof overlay (the open-PR
  sibling [[dashboard-issues]] deferred).

## scope

The whole subtree is **pending** — design only, no code. Out of scope until a build decision: any
implementation, a second (GitLab) driver, auto-remediation past a Tier-2 suggestion. This parent owns only
the cross-cutting shape and the load-bearing decision; [[ci-gate]] keeps the deterministic backstop,
[[session-eval]] the evidence engine, [[spec-lint]] the graph rules.
