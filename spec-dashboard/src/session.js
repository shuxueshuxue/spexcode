// @@@ session view helpers - shared by every session surface (the top-right SessionWindow, the Enter
// SessionInterface, the SessionGraph, the mobile cards) so they label and colour a session identically.
// Previously each surface hand-rolled its own copy of these and they could silently drift.

// @@@ STATUS_COLOR - the SINGLE status→colour map. One source for BOTH the liveness dot AND the status
// word, on every surface, so a session's state reads the same hue wherever it appears (window row, console
// tab + header, @-mention row, search row, session graph, mobile card). Deliberately just FOUR hues — a
// traffic light plus grey — the word still spells the exact state; the colour only answers "does this need
// me?", so a glance sorts the board without a legend:
//   green  = on track, no action from you: working (busy) or parked (paused, will self-resume)
//   yellow = waiting on YOU: asking / review / done (answer it, or review & merge)
//   red    = error (something broke)
//   grey   = stopped / dormant: idle / starting / queued / close-pending / offline
// Values are theme tokens (styles.css :root) so the palette stays Solarized and single-sourced; green for
// `working` also agrees with the avatar liveness ring (av-st-working). var() resolves in inline styles.

// description available. A human rename (`name`) still wins — the [[session-rename]] override is
// authoritative everywhere. Otherwise the worker's LIVE tmux self-summary (`activity`, see [[session-activity]])
// takes the line: an agent-generated description of what it's doing right now, sharper than the few words a
// human typed at launch. Before that label exists (booting / queued / offline) it falls back to the first
// words of the launch prompt (`promptPreview`) as a placeholder, then node / title / branch / id. Distinct
// from sessionName: the headline is ALLOWED to change each turn as the agent renarrates — the avatar (seeded
// by id) is the fixed spatial anchor, not this line. The console's big-title header (si-th-name) reads this
// SAME line too — identical source/content to the rows, only with more room before it truncates — so the
// title over the terminal renarrates in lock-step with the row that opened it.
