// @@@ board-stream — the board's freshness is PUSHED, not polled. A dashboard subscribes here ONCE; in
// plain mode it gets a bare `graph-changed` and refetches /api/graph (the legacy protocol, kept verbatim
// for old clients); in DELTA mode (`?mode=delta`) the server itself rebuilds on change and streams the
// hash-chained patch ([[graph-delta]]): a `graph-full {to, graph}` on connect, then `graph-delta
// {from, to, set, del}` per change — a few KB against the ~600KB snapshot, with a full-snapshot send
// whenever the patch wouldn't win (bigger than the board, or the unit decomposition's id-uniqueness
// precondition failed), so a delta subscriber is NEVER worse off than a full refetch.
//
// Every source carries the DOMAIN of the change it saw — 'sessions' (only the session rows moved) or 'full'
// (anything could have) — and fireChanged funnels them into ONE debounced pipeline, escalating to the max
// scope seen in the window so the cache can splice sessions instead of rebuilding whole ([[graph-cache]]).
// Sources: (1) fs.watch on the per-user session store — every lifecycle transition lands as a
// sessions/<id>/session.json write → 'sessions'; (2) fs.watch on the shared git dir's refs (+
// packed-refs/HEAD) — a commit/merge moves a ref, reshaping the tree → 'full'; (3) fs.watch on the git
// worktree REGISTRY (+ each live worktree's `.spec`) — an uncommitted spec edit in a linked worktree → 'full';
// (4) two subscriber-gated pollers of the tmux-derived signatures ([[sessions]]) that never touch a file —
// a 100ms HOT syscall poll and a 1s WARM tmux poll, both → 'sessions'; (5) a delta-gated ~15s cold-tick
// PATROL that invalidates FULL, rebuilds and diffs — the self-heal authority that catches whatever every
// leaf watcher missed (and is loud when it has to: see the repair accounting below) → 'full'. Plain mode
// without delta subscribers keeps its zero-build behavior: sources just fan out `graph-changed`.
