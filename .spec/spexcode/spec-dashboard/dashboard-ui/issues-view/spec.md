desc: The dashboard's ONE issues page — the Forum route (#/forum, [[side-nav]]) as a MASTER-DETAIL — a left list (evals leading, merged issues below) and a full-height detail pane the selection drives; markdown-rendered bodies and threads for both stores, node chips focus the graph, the detail's reply composer routes by store (forum commit or real forge comment).

# issues-view

## raw source

Issues are one object over every store ([[issues]]), and a human wants **one place** to read them — an
agent's local taste proposal and a GitHub issue on the same node belong on the same page, not on two
surfaces the user must correlate. So the dashboard carries ONE **Forum page** for them, a top-level page
of its own. The dashboard stays a **thin window** over the CLI's truth, never a second source —
it renders what `/api/issues` returns and computes nothing, and every write goes through the SAME
reply/propose the CLI uses, committed straight to the trunk.

## expanded spec

- **Entries — the forum is its OWN page.** The page lives at `#/forum` with its own [[side-nav]] rail
  entry — bookmarkable, reloadable, a peer of the graph and the session board. The keyboard doors are
  [[side-nav]]'s global ⌥ vocabulary — **⌥F / ⌥3** reach it from any page, the console included — plus
  the board's bare **`f` key** ([[keyboard-nav]]'s declarative keymap table, rebindable) as the direct
  jump from the graph. There is no console pill and no page-local shortcut anymore: one page, the shared
  doors. Esc never leaves the page ([[side-nav]]) — it stays with the page's own stack; going elsewhere
  is the rail, ⌥digit, or history.
- **The page is a MASTER-DETAIL — a full page deserves a full-height detail, never an expansion inside a
  box.** (The earlier pinned-two-region form was conceived for a height-starved overlay; on a routed
  full page it collapsed content into a small scrolling box — the human called it, and the form
  changed.) The **left column** is ONE box under a **prominent tab switcher — Evals | Threads** — the
  switcher IS the box's title (neither group carries a title of its own), so the column reads as one
  title plus one filter bar. (The earlier stacked two-region form split the height; the human asked for
  the switch instead — each tab now gets the FULL column.) Evals outrank issues: tab order and the
  default tab express it. The active tab shows its own filter bar under the switcher — the evals chips;
  the store filter + New + the concluded-count chip — with the **open/total meta at the END of the bar,
  never at its head**; the bar stays sticky over the tab's full-height list. Each tab's small count
  rides its switcher button, so the hidden tab is never a mystery. The hidden tab stays MOUNTED (its
  filter state and row reporting survive a flip). The **right pane** is the full-height DETAIL of the
  one selection — **selection IS detail** (email-style, no Enter, no in-place expansion): an issue
  renders its markdown body, an eval renders as the [[annotator]]. **j/k walk the ACTIVE tab's list**
  and the detail follows; a tab flip keeps the current selection (and its detail) until the human picks
  in the new tab; a key typed into an input is never captured. The section contents are their own nodes
  (children of this one, owned by the video-verification line); this node owns the page shell — the
  split, the tabs, the row grammar, the selection, and the j/k routing.
- **One merged list, store-tagged — RESIDENT, never cold-fetched.** The list is app-held state beside the
  board (one data path): the page renders instantly from it on every visit; freshness inherits the
  board's own pattern — the push/change signal triggers a throttled refetch, the 15s cold lane backstops
  (forge-cache updates arrive nowhere else), and `GET /api/issues` answers **304 via ETag** so a no-change
  refetch costs headers only. A write forces the refetch so it shows up where it lands. The view renders
  each issue **in the order the API returns**: the frontend
  never re-sorts, and **shows no salience/priority ranking** (recurrence is the drain's judgment, per
  [[proposals]], never an automatic order); signer and reply counts appear as raw data, not a rank.
  **Concluded issues hide by default** — closed / rejected / landed are the archive, not the open work,
  and mixing them in only confuses review; a count chip reveals them on demand (open and accepted stay:
  accepted is approved-but-not-landed, still live). The group head carries a **store filter** — a small
  dropdown whose options are DERIVED from the stores actually present in the data plus "all" (never a
  hardcoded list: a new store's driver landing puts it in the menu for free), defaulting to "all" so the
  stores stay mixed; picking one narrows rows AND the head's counts to that store, and the control hides
  itself when only one store exists. An
  issue's ROW is one compact line — store chip, concern, status, reply count; its DETAIL carries the full
  header (status, author, signer count, node chips, permalink) over the **markdown-rendered body and
  replies** — the same SpecBody renderer the spec panes use, so forum markdown and spec markdown read as
  one dialect (raw `##`/table pipes never show), and a forge issue's GitHub comments render as the SAME
  reply thread a forum thread gets ([[issues]] maps them into `replies[]` — one thread type, one
  renderer). Store never changes the shape; the only store-specific affordances are metadata (a local
  issue's signer count, a forge issue's permalink) — the thread itself reads and writes identically.
- **Node chips focus the graph.** An issue's node chips are clickable — a click routes to the graph page
  and **focuses that node**, so the page stays anchored to the graph it discusses.
- **A human writes from here — to the issue's OWN store.** EVERY issue's detail carries a **reply
  composer** (a textarea + Send): the POST goes to the one store-routed reply verb ([[issues]]'s
  `replyIssue`, author `'human'`) — a local issue's reply git-commits to the trunk forum, a forge issue's
  reply posts a REAL GitHub comment through the driver — then reloads so the post shows where it landed
  (the forge case shows the server's read-back, and a failed forge write surfaces in the composer, never
  a silent swallow). The issue group's head carries a **New** affordance that opens a fresh LOCAL issue
  (a one-line concern, optional `[[node]]` links, an optional body — new threads open local; promotion
  moves one to the forge). The dashboard adds no store of its own. A `@session`/`@new` in the text
  **dispatches** ([[mentions]]) exactly as a CLI post would, whatever the store — a human summons an
  agent from any thread, and that mention IS the "assign to an agent" verb; the returned one-line
  dispatch summary is echoed briefly. Both composers carry the SAME `@session` / `[[node]]`
  **autocomplete dropdown** the console's inputs use ([[mentions]]'s shared menu — one implementation,
  never a page-local fork): typing `@` lists the live sessions, `[[` lists the nodes (the thread's own
  node leading), a pick inserts the token, and Esc closes the menu without leaving the page. A grammar
  that dispatches workers earns discoverability — a bare hint line proved not enough (the human typed
  `@` and got nothing).
  The reply list and reply composer are ONE shared component (`Thread.jsx`), delivery-agnostic (`onSend`):
  the issue detail replies to its thread — both stores, the server routing the delivery — and the eval
  detail ([[annotator]]) renders the SAME thread UI — autocomplete included — over its lazily-bound eval
  comment thread; one thread UI, every home, the store just a fourth delivery behind the same seam.
- **Honors the switch.** When the forum workflow is OFF (`enabled: false`, [[proposals]]'s toggle), the
  view shows a muted "off" state instead of the list — the dashboard reflects the one source of truth,
  never forks it.
