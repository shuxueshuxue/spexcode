# ci-gate

The dogfood ritual is advertised as "hook-enforced", but the git hooks are **advisory and per-clone**:
they live in `.git/hooks` (never committed), so a fresh checkout that skipped `npm run hooks` has *no*
gate — and nothing surfaces that gap. CLAUDE.md already names CI as the *real* gate; this node makes that
true instead of aspirational.

CI is the **non-bypassable** layer that runs on the forge, not on a developer's machine:

- **When** — every push to `main` and every pull request. A merge to `main` is therefore always checked,
  and a node branch is checked before it lands.
- **What** — the same gates the manager weighs at review plus the published-user smoke: **`spex lint`**
  (fails the build on *errors* — a broken spec↔code link or a changelog body; coverage and drift stay
  advisory warnings), the **[[dead-words]] gate** (fails the build if a retired v0.3.0 word resurfaces on a
  command/route/label/file/node surface — prose exempt), the **`tsc --noEmit`** type check on the CLI package, and a **pack/install smoke**
  that builds the npm tarball, installs it into a clean consumer project, runs `npx spex --help`, then runs
  `spex init` inside a fresh git repo and checks that `.spec/project/spec.md` and `spexcode.json` landed.
  Full git history is fetched because lint derives the version timeline and drift from git.
- **Why a backstop and not the only gate** — the [[main-guard]] hook still gives fast *local* feedback and
  blocks direct commits on `main`; CI guarantees the [[spec-lint]] contract holds even when that hook is
  absent or bypassed (`SPEXCODE_SKIP_LINT=1`). Defense in depth: local is convenience, CI is the truth.

This governs only the workflow definition. The lint rules and the type contract themselves live with
[[spec-lint]] and the package nodes; CI is purely the thing that *runs* them where they cannot be skipped.
