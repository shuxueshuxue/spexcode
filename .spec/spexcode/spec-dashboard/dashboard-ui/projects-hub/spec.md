# projects-hub

## raw source

One gateway now fronts many governed projects — [[gateway-hub]] landed the server contract (a root
catalog at `/projects`, every project surface under `/p/:projectId/*`, [[gateway-auth]]'s two signed
scopes). The dashboard needed the client half: somewhere to see and manage the fleet, addresses that make
one project shareable without revealing the rest, and one credential experience instead of a per-surface
zoo of prompts. UI only — routing/auth semantics stay on the gateway.

## expanded spec

**The pathname is the scope.** The same built SPA serves at the hub root `/` and at `/p/<id>/`; a scoped
page prefixes every `/api` call (fetch, SSE, terminal WebSocket) through the one seam in `project.js`, so
no feature module knows it is scoped and the address bar is always the shareable project URL — the form
the gateway gates by path. Unscoped serving (vite dev, single-project `spex serve ui`) yields base `''`
and stays byte-identical to the pre-multi-project app; a dev proxy rule maps `/p/*/api` onto the one dev
backend so scoped pages are drivable without a hub.

**One global admin page over the landed contract.** `ProjectsPage` renders the host's reconciled
KNOWN-project view ([[host-gateway]]): a repo enters the fleet by running `spex serve` in it, or through
the page's add drawer (`POST /projects` with the repo root; a non-repo's refusal is shown verbatim).
Each row shows liveness — the host's instance-validated `online` refined by a probed `/p/:id/health` dot
when online, while an offline row calmly reads *stopped*, never probed into a false red — the gating
state, a password set/clear drawer (`PUT`/`DELETE /projects/:id/password`), and one primary action per
state: Open when online (a plain link to `/p/<id>/#/graph` — switching projects is ordinary same-tab
navigation, extra tabs always optional) or Start when offline (`POST /projects/:id/serve` answers only
when the booted backend's record reconciles online, so success means reachable). The setup drawer runs
the real repo verbs (`POST /projects/:id/init|doctor`): init demands the EXPLICIT harness choice
(nothing picked, nothing run) with the optional preset alongside; every run renders its exit code and
full transcript in place, a failure stays on screen, and the same button is the retry. The header owns
the ADMIN password (`PUT`/`DELETE /projects/admin-password`): `adminGated:false` renders the bootstrap
hint — management is implicit-loopback-only until a password exists, and the set response rotates the
setter's cookie so they stay signed in. Freshness is a plain poll — registration, a just-started
backend, and health flips land on their own. The page mounts only as the global hub face at `/projects`
(the shell shows it when there is no board but `/projects` answers — [[dashboard-shell]] owns that boot
pick). A `/p/<id>/` shell contains only project-owned views and never mounts the page or advertises its
management controls in the rail. The old direct `/p/<id>/#/projects` address remains a compatibility door:
arrival performs one full-page redirect to `/projects`, leaving no duplicate in-shell admin route behind.
The rail's current-project chip and catalog-backed switcher remain the scoped project's one project-changing
control.

**One credential card, two doors, no catalog leak.** `CredentialGate` is the single credential
experience: the global `/projects` admin sign-in (`POST /login`) and a project unlock
(`POST /p/<id>/login`) are the same
calm card with different words — the same JSON `{password}` post the hub's own designed login page
speaks. Denial is read from the status, exactly as the hub answers: 401 wants credentials
('admin-login' on the catalog, 'project-login' on a scoped api), 403 is the locked admin surface — the
card's locked variant is a dead end by design, naming the loopback repair path. It appears wherever a
401 strikes in-app; an admin session bypasses project prompts because the admin cookie authorizes every
`/p/*` route server-side. A direct-project guest never sees the catalog or any global management control:
the probe is denied, so the switcher menu is absent and the project shell exposes only its current-project
identity and project-owned pages — absence of data, not a hidden element.

**The contract lives in one module.** `projects.js` is the only place the hub routes are spelled — the
catalog read, the password writes, the credential posts, and the management verbs (add / init / doctor /
serve); every reader is tolerant (a pre-hub server's SPA-fallback HTML reads as "absent", a hub without
the host extension leaves `online` unknown and the UI falls back to probe-only health, unknown fields
default) so the same frontend runs against every deployment generation. All hub/credential/selector
styling reads the shared palette AND typography tokens only — every theme preset skins these surfaces,
the setup drawer, and the transcript block with no extra rules.
