# @@@ harness.sh - the SHELL face of the [[harness-adapter]] (spec-cli/src/harness.ts). The hook scripts run
# as pure shell, so they cannot import the TS adapter; this sourced library is its mirror. dispatch.sh sources
# it and exports SPEXCODE_HARNESS (claude|codex) — baked into the shim by each adapter, so a hook learns its
# harness deterministically, never by sniffing the payload shape. EVERY harness-divergent payload-parse lives
# HERE; the hook scripts stay harness-agnostic and just call hp_* (the one place Claude's tool names appear in
# shell, plus codex's Bash-command mapping). The session-id + global-store resolution is harness-agnostic and
# lives here too, so the six hooks no longer each repeat the git-common-dir → project-key dance.

# the string value of a top-level JSON string field (first match). Harness-agnostic — both harnesses' payloads
# carry session_id / tool_name as plain string fields. $1 = payload, $2 = field name. The value is scanned as a
# real JSON string: the closing quote is the first UNESCAPED `"`, so a value containing `\"` (a quoted literal
# inside a codex Bash/apply_patch command — extremely common) is captured WHOLE, not truncated at the inner
# quote. The standard escapes are decoded (`\"` `\\` `\/` `\n` `\t` `\r` `\b` `\f`), so a patch envelope's `\n`
# arrives as a real newline here (the downstream codex decode then no-ops). Pure awk, no jq on the hot path.

# of them are emitted, one per line, so the consuming hook acts on every touched file (a single-file patch
